		<description><![CDATA[Great article Minna!

I recently started http://fancycrave.com/ as a side project a few months ago. The site consists of completely free stock photos all taken by me and other talented photographers. It’s basically a collection of images from my travels around South East Asia, North America, and South America (soon). My aim for these photos is to help designers and creative alike. People can use these images for whatever purpose they please.

I keep things very simple. I list the photo, its tags, the author, and the download link. I don&#039;t make people jump through any hoop, like signing up for an email newsletter or making them &quot;Like&quot; my facebook page.

I also started to publish niche specific photo packs all for free.

I hope you and others will find it valuable. I just want to contribute back to the wonderful blogging, design, marketing, and creative community. If you see it fit, I&#039;d be very grateful if you could add Fancycrave to this list.

Cheers!]]></description>
