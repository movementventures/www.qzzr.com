	    	<h2 class="mb5 h">Qzzr Terms of Service</h2>

				<p>Let’s keep this simple, shall we?</p>

				<p>This is a contract between you and the folks at <a href="http://movementventures.com" target="blank">Movement Ventures</a> (who created Qzzr.com - “Qzzr”) when you use the <a href="http://qzzr.com" target="blank">Qzzr site</a> (“Site”) and the services and products found there (“Services”).</p>

				<p>We’re excited that you’re using Qzzr and would love your feedback.  We created Qzzr to allow anyone to create a quiz and share it with the world.  We think that we’re doing something pretty special here and have only the best intentions.  We’re sure you do too, but we hafta write this document because not everyone does.  So here goes a lot of words that just sum up one idea - be nice.</p>

				<p>With that said, we think everyone should read this before accessing our site.  </p>
			</section>

			<section class="section page-section">
				<h3>This is a binding agreement</h3>
				<p>By accessing or using any part of the web site, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the Site or use any services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by Qzzr, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="page-section">
				<h3>Who can use our Services</h3>
				<p>Qzzr is only for human adults and teenagers above the age of 18 years old.  If you are a cyborg, mutant, or mean person you are not allowed here.</p>	
			</section>
		

			<section class="page-section">
				<h3>We can change our Services</h3>
				<p>We may change any aspect of the service we want, or even stop it, at any time without giving you notice.  We can also terminate or restrict access to it at any time, in our sole discretion.  Termination of your access and use of Qzzr Services shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing before the termination.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="page-section">
				<h3>Your Qzzr Account</h3>
				<p>If you create or take a quiz on the Site, you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with your account. You must not use your account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and Qzzr may change content that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause Qzzr liability.

				<h3>Your content</h3>
				<p>
					You own the rights to the content you post on Qzzr.  We do not claim ownership over it.  However, by posting content to Qzzr, you give us permission to use your content, free of charge, to do the things we need to do to provide Qzzr Services which may include storing, displaying, reproducing, and distributing your content.  By publishing on Qzzr, you agree to allow others to view your content.  You are free to delete your content at any time.  If you delete your account or content, it may be unrecoverable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some things we forbid.  By using Qzzr, you promise not to do any of the following things:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						post any comments, material, links, text, images, audio, or video (any such material, “Content”) containing any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
					</li>
					<li>
						post Content without permission from the owner;
					</li>
					<li>
						post Content that is pornographic, contains threats, incites violence, or violates the rights of any third party.
					</li>
					<li>
						probe, scan, or test our systems or networks;
					</li>
					<li>
						break or circumvent any technologies we have put in place for security or authentication;
					</li>
					<li>
						attempt to access Qzzr Services by means other than currently available;
					</li>
					<li>
						scrape Qzzr Services or Content;
					</li>
					<li>
						violate the intellectual property or personal privacy rights of others, causing harm to others, or violating any criminal laws where Qzzr has a physical location;
 					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For more information about what we feel is appropriate on Qzzr, view our <a href="/content">content guidelines</a>.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="page-section">
				<h3>Fees &amp; payments</h3>
				<p>You agree to pay for the Services you use on the Qzzr Site in accordance the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that service.  Fees paid by you are non-refundable except as provided in these terms or when required by law.</p>
 
				<p>For subscriptions, you will be billed in advance on a recurring cycle for the period you have selected (monthly or annually) at the beginning of that period.  Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each period unless you cancel before your next renewal date.</p>

			  <p>You can cancel your service at any time.  If you cancel, no refund will be provided for fees paid and your service will remain active through the end of the current paid period.</p>
 
				<p>Qzzr may change the fees charged for Services at any time, provided that, for subscription Services, the change will become effective only upon the next renewal date.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="page-section">
				<h3>Upgrades</h3>
				<p>An upgrade is when a paying customer decides to change their current plan to a more expensive paid plan. </p>
				<p>When upgrading in the middle of a billing period, you will be charged a pro-rated amount for the remaining days in the billing period.  At the end of the billing period, the upgraded plan will auto-renew.</p>
				<p>Let’s provide an example - Jane subscribed to the $49/mo plan on January 1st and upgrades to the $99/mo plan on January 15th.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>On January 1st, we charge Jane $49.00.</li>
					<li>On January 15th, Jane upgrades and we charge Jane $25.76 (16 pro-rated days of the difference of $50.00 between the two plans).
</li>
					<li>On February 1st, Jane’s plan will auto-renew and we will charge her $99.00.
</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			
			<section class="page-section">
				<h3>Downgrades</h3>
				<p>A downgrade is when a paying customer chooses to change their plan from a more expensive to a less expensive (but still paid) plan.  When a paying customer decides to switch from a paid plan to the free plan, that is called a cancellation.</p>
				<p>When downgrading in the middle of a billing period, your account will receive a credit (not a refund) for the pro-rated amount for the remaining days in the billing period.  The credit will be applied toward the downgraded plan which will auto-renew at the start of the next billing period.</p>
				<p>Let’s provide an example - John subscribed to the $99/mo plan on January 1st and downgrades to the $49/mo plan on January 15th.
</p>
				<ol>
					<li>On January 1st, we charge John $99.00.</li>
					<li> On January 15th, John downgrades and we credit John for $51.04.  $25.76 of this credit is used to pay for the pro-rated amount of the remaining days of the $49.00 plan, leaving a $25.28 credit on his account.</li>
					<li>On February 1st, we apply the remaining $25.28 credit and charge John $23.72 (the difference between the credit and the $49/mo plan fee).</li>
				</ol>
