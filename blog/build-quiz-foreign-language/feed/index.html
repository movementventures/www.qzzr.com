		<description><![CDATA[Hi Maria,
We can definitely help you with duplicating your quiz. Can you send an email to support@qzzr.com letting us know which quiz you want duplicated?


And can you also let us know what languages you want your quiz translated into?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I want to make a bilingual quiz, meaning having two identical quizes but in different languages. And I don&#039;t want to build it twice manually. Is there a possibility to copy&amp;paste a quiz, so the structure stays the same and I just change the lines?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Osama-
Thanks for commenting. We would love to offer Arabic, and have been working on coming up with a way to manage that, since the Right ==&gt; Left orientation of the writing takes more development than for our primary languages. We&#039;ll keep you updated on our progress, so keep checking back for updates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great to hear from you, Frank. Absolutely – from within your account, click on the &quot;Need Help?&quot; tab in the bottom right corner. Our product team would love to take a look at what that would entail and see if we can&#039;t get you taken care of. Thanks for the feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well, cool, but I guess it will take a long time before you make a danish version.  No need to tranlate the backend, but if it was possible for the user to change the word &quot;Result&quot; in the end, nobody who takes the quiz will notice any english then. And yes, all danes will understand &quot;result&quot; as the danish word is &quot;resultat&quot; but it looks silly with just one english word in the quiz.]]></description>
