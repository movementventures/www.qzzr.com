		<description><![CDATA[Hey Harold, good question. Sometimes it&#039;s hard to think of enough good questions. After you write out your results, I recommend writing out at least three distinct traits about each of them, and then, it starts to be more clear what differentiates each of the results. That should give you a good foundation to come up with questions to steer people into one of your results. 
By the way, we just published another blog post about how to overcome writer&#039;s block when creating a quiz: http://blog.qzzr.com/writers-block-sucks-3-tips-overcome-help-create-quizzes/]]></description>
