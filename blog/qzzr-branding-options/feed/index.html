		<description><![CDATA[Hi
I could previously remove the FB like ad on the results page in the free version, I can&#039;t find where this is anymore. Have you removed this option. If so, that&#039;s a shame as on the phone with an embed you cant easily scroll past your facebook page to actually see the result of the quiz. I couldn&#039;t actually scroll past the facebook ad, which obviously defeated the purpose. 
Let me know in case its just me.
Thanks
Steve]]></description>
