<h5>International marketing is now easier—and more difficult—than ever</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Tips for creating international quizzes</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>With Qzzr, global quiz creation is now available in 14 languages</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will help you create interactive content in an international world, but many of these global quiz techniques apply directly to overall marketing and content creation as well.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Use the advice inasmuch as it makes sense to do so, but never take anything as a hard and fast rule. Every country and culture (and the many subsets within) is different, and the moment you assume anything, you lose the indispensable ability to adapt.<br />
</em><br />
In the old days (pre-Kardashian), when a tech company decided to expand globally, it usually meant one of two things: (1) domestic business had stabilized to the point that taking on the risks of moving into new markets seemed justified, or (2) they were bat-sh** crazy.</p>
<p>Today, our environment couldn’t be more different. The expansion of the internet and web-based SaaS tools has all but eliminated most of the barriers preventing expansion into international spaces. Potential foreign customers are looking for you before you can look for them. There’s one rapidly-growing market, and everyone is playing in it.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it’s easy, however—especially in the marketing world. The mere ability to reach out and tap people on the other side of the world in seconds doesn’t mean that they’ll want to listen to—or be able to understand—what you have to say.</p>
<h2>Consider these tips when building a global quiz strategy:</h2>
<h3>1. Find boots on the ground</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1588" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boots.png" alt="When creating a global quiz strategy, make sure you have boots on the ground." width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>Don’t try and do this alone, and from a different country. Find someone local that loves your brand as much as you do, and who brings the right blend of creativity and technical skills to the table. Don’t skimp on payment, as this person or team of people will be the backbone of your operation.</p>
<h3>2. Do your research</h3>
<p>With any marketing campaign, research is important. When trying to get a marketing effort off the ground in a new country, research is essential. Quiz creation is no different. While there are certain techniques that will translate to any campaign, you’ll find that many (if not most) of the normal methods will need at least some adjustment.</p>
<p>There are an innumerable amount of factors to consider, but begin your effort here:</p>
<h4>Personas</h4>
<p>Who is your ideal customer and how will they interact with your brand? Address differences in organizational structure, decision making, and budgetary management. It’s possible that the job titles and roles that you targeted domestically don’t exist in a new culture, or that they handle different responsibilities.</p>
<p>Your ideal customer may also have very different challenges than what you’re used to. You need to identify the individual pain points and evaluate how your product or service can resolve them. This will determine how you structure your content, and how they’ll perceive it.</p>
<p>It’s also very possible that they find information in a very different way than you’re used to. Whereas before you had a lot of success promoting quizzes on social media, you may find that these channels are dry in a new environment.</p>
<p>There has been much written on the practice of defining buyer personas, so I won’t go into more detail. <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide" target="_blank">Buffer</a> has a great guide, as does <a href="http://offers.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>—and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2014/10/28/how-to-develop-your-buyer-persona-and-reel-in-better-customers/" target="_blank">a great article from Forbes</a>. What’s important is that you use them. Don’t try and get by on your existing personas, or worse—on winging it. Take the time to understand your new audience, and your quizzes will be much more successful.</p>
<h4>Competition</h4>
<p>Who else is present in your market, and how will their offerings affect yours? Find gaps and use these in your quizzes and other content. If you provide a necessary service, make sure you use that fact in your messaging.</p>
<h4>Cultural considerations</h4>
<p>Everyone has heard a story or two about an over-eager salesman blowing a major deal by inadvertently insulting his foreign hosts. Don’t let that be you.</p>
<p>Quizzes are by nature interactive—they require customer involvement. While there is incredible opportunity for engagement and conversion there—and we’ve obviously built our business around that—their involvement means you have to consider what is going to attract and repel potential customers in your new area.</p>
<h4>Social networks</h4>
<p>While Facebook is the definite worldwide leader in social media, it’s not the top dog everywhere—Japanese Twitter users outnumber Facebook accounts by nearly 4 million, and that divide is likely to widen. And did you know that Twitter is only the fifth most popular social media network in the world?</p>
<p>Find out where the important conversations are taking place and position yourself there. Test to find out where people are most likely to share, then center your quiz promotion there to drive social traffic and generate leads.</p>
<h4>Techniques</h4>
<p>You’re entering a new space, where new temperatures, attitudes, and preferences prevail. Your old bag of tricks may not cut it—whether you’ll need to adjust tactics isn’t the question, it’s how much and in what ways.</p>
<p>You may have to find out whether quizzes resonate better within your content marketing or social media strategies. And an accurate understanding of email usage will go a long way towards determining how much time and resources you need to spend on email marketing.</p>
<p>Also consider the cultural perception of things like jokes—while your sense of humor may be your greatest asset in building relationships and communities for your brand, it’s going to be a lot harder to convey that through a translator. Even in your native tongue, humor can differ from region to region (see “Bean, Mr.”).</p>
<h4>Web consumption habits</h4>
<p>You’ll want to identify how people use the internet. Find out a breakdown of mobile/desktop usage, and this will help you construct your content. If you’re using a quiz platform like Qzzr, no need to worry! Quizzes are all responsive, all the time, meaning they’ll look great however people consume them.</p>
<p>While this is becoming less of an issue worldwide, consider your audience’s access to internet. In many places, the majority of people use the internet in cafes or have limited bandwidth. If either of these is the case, consider limiting the length of the quiz or keeping hi-res or animated images to a minimum.</p>
<h3>3. Be human</h3>
<p>Cultural differences aside, we are all still human, which means we need to engage with our customers as such. If done right, quizzes engage people in a peer-to-peer manner, because they’re playing against themselves—or their own perception of themselves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1578" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stop-telling-me-quote.jpg" alt="Stop telling me quote" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>This will greatly affect how your brand transitions to a new culture, and testifies to the need for great people on the ground. Don’t waste an engagement opportunity by sounding like an inanimate (foreign) entity.</p>
<h3>4. Have the right tools</h3>
<p>If you have the right tools, international expansion will be much easier. In another recent Forbes post, online entrepreneur John Rampton <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/05/15/how-to-grow-and-manage-international-teams/" target="_blank">shared a list of tools to use when managing an international team</a>.</p>
<p>While communicating with a team of people whose first language is not that of your business, you’ll obviously face challenges. But above and beyond that, you need to make sure they’re able to understand and use the tools involved in their day-to-day operations. Make sure their tools speak to them in their own way—you can’t afford not to. They won’t use what they don’t understand, and at this point, your endeavor is substantially dependent on data.</p>
<p>The list will be very industry-specific, but start with your CRM, marketing automation platform, email marketing and—obviously—quiz creation tool. All of these will play into how successful your campaign will be. Your quiz will be affected by how well preparation, execution, and follow up are tracked, so make sure your data integrity is on point.</p>
<p>Cool note: Did you know that Qzzr is multilingual? You can currently build quizzes in several different languages—14 to be exact:</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>Chinese Simplified</li>
<li>Dutch</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<ul>
<li>Norwegian</li>
<li>Portuguese</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Swedish</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Polish</li>
<li>Serbian</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>5. Images</h3>
<p>Just two quick notes on images. First—use them. Second—make sure they reflect your new environment. A quiz is not going to be nearly as engaging if it’s filled with imagery that looks foreign or impersonal.</p>
<p>Don’t let this happen:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1590" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Cultural-imagery-1.png" alt="Cultural imagery (1)" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>This is not just about race—though you should consider that. There are landscape/environmental variances, demographic factors, and overall cultural themes that will either make your campaign stick out like a sore thumb, or seamlessly integrate with the consumer’s life. Don’t blow the powerful engaging feeling of a quiz by using images that alienate or confuse.</p>
<h3>6. Test and improve</h3>
<p>What you need most is the ability to adapt to new circumstances, like some sort of highly intelligent mutant quizzing chameleon—yeah, like that. Test mercilessly and endlessly to determine your best course of action. Play with brand voice, images, quiz types and topics, and time of launch to determine your best playbook. You’ll know when you get it right—your share rate will reflect it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Expanding into new markets is not easy—but don’t let it discourage you. It can be done, and the rewards are many. Put in the hard work, and you’ll start to reap the benefits of global quiz domination. But please, use your powers for good.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">we release Pollcaster</a>.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it’s been a year since we launched Qzzr. Since then, we’ve seen hundreds of millions of questions answered on thousands of quizzes created by some of the top publishers and brands in the world. We’ve been involved in just about every major cultural phenomenon from <a href="http://gawker.com/what-color-is-this-goddamn-dress-1688330170" target="_blank">#dressgate</a> to <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6995741/quiz-skin-or-leggings" target="_blank">leggings</a>, and seen a grip of savvy businesses use quizzes to boost revenue, engagement, and web traffic—<a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank">[one quiz in particular has netted almost half a million in revenue (!)]</a>. We could say things have gone well, but it would be like <a href="https://youtu.be/oqq-glymrRs" target="_blank">calling the knuckle-puck moderately effective</a>.</p>
<p>One question keeps popping up: “Why don’t you guys do polls? If you made a poll tool with the same magic as Qzzr, I would use it every day.” Well, that day is here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Pollcaster</a> is like no other. Our CEO Josh Little was adamant that it contain all the same “secret-saucomeness” that Qzzr does, employing impeccable visuals and engaging stats to make every poll as insanely shareable as our quizzes. And boy, does it deliver.</p>
<div class="mv-widget" data-widget="poll" data-id="1pVE992iXJ8CkscH5q5dQOHHSxN" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></div>
<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script>At face value, the poll is already impressive, and stands apart from other poll tools on the market. But add to that an ability to see a breakdown of results by region, age, and gender—insights that let your audience step into the results to see where they fit in. <img class=" size-full wp-image-1478 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jalopnik-poll.png" alt="jalopnik poll" width="655" height="326" /> The magic of these polls is in the breakdown, which will transport you into a world of compelling graphics, where you can dive in and explore the data yourself. <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/breakdown.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1479 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/breakdown.png" alt="breakdown" width="924" height="325" /></a> Try one out—here’s one that our friends over at Jalopnik recently posted. </p>
<div class="mv-widget" data-widget="poll" data-id="TNTYj5tcvgzshaRoIq7Qm0JW1m1" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></div>
<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Go create your first poll right now</a>. It’s completely free and super easy. You can even log in with your Qzzr account.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, sign up for a webinar we’re hosting tomorrow (Thursday, April 16, 2015): <a href="http://go.pollcaster.com/pollcaster-webinar/" target="_blank">How to Make the Most Engaging Polls on the Planet</a>. In it, our CEO and Chief Evangelist will discuss:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things about making a quiz on Qzzr is the ability to <strong>make it yours</strong>. You can customize it with your own images and colors, and you can get as creative as you want with the questions you create.</p>
<p>You can also add a profile picture that will show up at the bottom of your quiz. By default, you will get a generic profile picture that will look something like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1391" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/generic-profile-picture-300x297.png" alt="generic profile picture" width="300" height="297" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the worst thing in the world, but we know you&#8217;d probably rather see your own face or logo in that space. For instance, if you&#8217;re espnW, it makes much more sense to have this image show up <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11128656/espnw-cheering-wrong-world-cup-team" target="_blank">on the start page of your quiz</a>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1392" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/espnprofile.png" alt="espnprofile" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>To set your profile picture, log in to your account, and then click on that little circle in the top right corner. If you&#8217;ve never changed your profile picture, that circle will have your initials.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1404" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.41.03-AM.png" alt="dashboard" width="996" height="513" /></p>
<p>That will bring up a dropdown menu, and the first item on the list will be &#8220;Edit profile.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1406" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.43.21-AM.png" alt="edit profile dropdown" width="467" height="337" /></p>
<p>Once you click on &#8220;Edit profile,&#8221; it will take you to a page where you can edit your name, username, bio, site, and Twitter handle. You can add your profile picture by clicking on the camera icon.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1407" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.44.54-AM.png" alt="edit profile page" width="998" height="438" /></p>
<p>Once you click on it, you can upload a picture of your choosing. It will upload with your new picture, and then you just have to hit &#8220;SAVE CHANGES&#8221; in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1408" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.46.25-AM.png" alt="profile page with picture" width="1023" height="400" /></p>
<p><strong>Some helpful tips about choosing your profile picture</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that this will show up at the bottom of your quiz. It&#8217;s a tiny but important piece of real estate, so you will want it to look great.</p>
<p>It will show up as a perfect circle, so try to use images with even dimensions. If you want to see how your image will look as a circle, I found a quick and dirty way to figure that out. Just open up PowerPoint, and then drag your image onto one of the slides.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1401" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.24.19-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-18 at 10.24.19 AM" width="800" height="524" /></p>
<p>While your image is selected, click on the down arrow next to the &#8220;Crop&#8221; button, and that will bring up a dropdown menu. From the list of options, hover over &#8220;Mask to Shape,&#8221; then go to &#8220;Basic Shapes,&#8221; and then select the oval.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1402" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.27.13-AM.png" alt="select oval" width="800" height="523" /></p>
<p>Then, you can right click on the updated image and click on &#8220;Save as Picture.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1403 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.31.28-AM.png" alt="save image" width="800" height="523" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve recently run an experiment on Facebook with different Share Images and got some pretty significant results.</p>
<p>Here are the variations we tested:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-339 aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-10-31-at-9.15.53-AM.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-31 at 9.15.53 AM" width="618" height="439" /><span id="more-1008"></span></p>
<p>Having just an image with no text performed the worst. Only getting between 6-8% click through rates (CTR).</p>
<p>Adding text to the image boosted the CTR to about 12% CTR.</p>
<p>However, adding text AND a Call to Action increased the CTR to 22% on mobile and 28% on Desktop!</p>
<p>Of course we expect this to vary depending on the quality of the image and the title, but starting today we are implementing a new default design for share images.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Wallpapers-Of-Albert-Einstein.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-341 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Wallpapers-Of-Albert-Einstein-1024x576.jpg" alt="100th Anniversary Of Einstein's Theory of Relativity" width="614" height="346" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;ve bolded the text and added a contrasting red button at the bottom.  We will be continuing to try and beat this share image design and we encourage you to as well!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the quiz settings we are adding the ability for you to customize the share image. It can now be different than your background image, and you can either remove our text or customize it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-8.59.47-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-342 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-8.59.47-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-06 at 8.59.47 AM" width="247" height="317" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;d love to hear your feedback on this feature, and we hope you enjoy all the additional traffic you&#8217;ll be getting!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that we have listened to your feedback and have reduced the Qzzr branding on Standard and Plus plans! Here&#8217;s what has changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qzzr Ad on results page is gone</li>
<li>Take another quiz section is gone</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve removed &#8220;On Qzzr!&#8221; from the share and tweet text</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve removed the #quizzes hashtag from the tweet text</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes are currently live and should already have taken effect on your quizzes.</p>
<p>Also, with the launch of Qzzr.com, Qzzr users can now search and browse all of our quizzes. We are now rolling out public user profiles to help people find other quizzes by any author. Your public Qzzr profile will list all of your published, listed quizzes along with your avatar, and profile information.<span id="more-1005"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.28.15-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-304" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.28.15-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-22 at 10.28.15 AM" width="642" height="533" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With this change the &#8220;Author badge&#8221; on your embedded quizzes will link to your public profile where people can see and take all of your quizzes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.42.37-AM-2.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-305" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.42.37-AM-2.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-22 at 10.42.37 AM 2" width="426" height="373" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you do not want one of your quizzes to show up on Qzzr.com you can choose to hide them with the quiz setting &#8220;Hide on Qzzr.com&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.32.29-AM-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.32.29-AM-2.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-22 at 10.32.29 AM 2" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have unfinished quizzes or quizzes that you no longer want to be taken by people you can also unpublish them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.57.51-AM-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-308" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-10.57.51-AM-2.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-22 at 10.57.51 AM 2" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To give you a little time to spruce up your profile information and publicly viewable quizzes, we&#8217;ve rolled this Author badge link into Qzzr labs for 1 week. Next week (10/31/14) it will go live to all customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As always, questions and feedback are super important to us&#8230; so don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to support@qzzr.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We asked you guys what you wanted us to build for you while we were Hawaii. We had an amazing response to our quiz:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.07.33-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-291 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.07.33-AM-1024x482.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.07.33 AM" width="717" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>The top two most requested features were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change Quiz/Question type on the fly</li>
<li>Image cropping tools</li>
</ul>
<p>The team worked really hard (with some surf breaks in between) to get these features done during our Hawaiian hackathon. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of the new stuff!</p>
<p><strong>Change Quiz/Question type on the fly</strong></p>
<p>Ever select the wrong question type and then have to delete the question and recreate it? We&#8217;ll now you can easily switch the question type after you have created it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.28.21-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-294 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.28.21-AM-1024x754.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.28.21 AM" width="717" height="528" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Same thing goes for switching the quiz type. If you made a graded quiz by accident and then decide it was supposed to be an outcome quiz, you can switch the quiz type in the settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.33.00-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-295 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.33.00-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.33.00 AM" width="524" height="262" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Image cropping</strong></p>
<p>You can now crop your images right in the Qzzr quiz maker. Just go ahead and upload an image as you&#8217;ve always done. We&#8217;ll do a default crop on it, but if you want to change the way that it is cropped, just hover over the image to show the crop icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.02.53-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-292 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.02.53-AM-1024x744.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.02.53 AM" width="717" height="521" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will launch the crop window. See below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.03.28-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-293 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.03.28-AM-1024x833.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.03.28 AM" width="717" height="583" /></a></p>
<p>This works on question images, answer images, and the background image as well!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Man, we are <strong>so excited</strong> to be releasing this feature. Not only has it been requested by a ton of our customers, we have very good reason to believe it will increase the share rates on your quizzes!</p>
<p>The share rates on graded quizzes have been  lower than on outcome quizzes. We hope by letting you add custom result titles, descriptions, and result images to specific score ranges will make for a much more compelling reason for people to share!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p>1. Create a graded quiz and click &#8216;Define Results&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-270" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults1-1024x604.png" alt="gradedresults1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Add your results and define the score buckets. You can do that by dragging the handles to define the range or dragging from the middle to move the range to another score.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-271" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults2.png" alt="gradedresults2" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You&#8217;ll notice in my quiz there is a 50 percent gap between the lowest result and the next highest. You can define a &#8216;Catch-all result&#8217; to fill in anywhere you don&#8217;t have score defined.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults3.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-272" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults3.png" alt="gradedresults3" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Depending on what score the user receives at the end, they&#8217;ll be given the coinciding result!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-273" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults4.png" alt="gradedresults4" /></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>
