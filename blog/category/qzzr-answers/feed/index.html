				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s make a wager. I bet you a <a href="https://twitter.com/QzzrCowboy">Qzzr Cowboy $2 bill</a> that you can’t scroll down your social feed without being asked to enter a giveaway.</p>
<p>We all love to win free stuff, right? With few exceptions, we’ll happily go to some pretty crazy lengths for a chance at something we don’t necessarily need.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Oprah-Prize.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1475 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Oprah-Prize.jpg" alt="Oprah Prize" width="625" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>Businesses often turn to giveaways to increase social engagement, gain email subscribers, perform market research, or just improve brand perception.</p>
<p>Putting on a giveaway ain’t all fun and games, though, right? As <a href="http://www.inc.com/jim-belosic/social-media-giveaways-are-your-assumptions-preventing-success.html" target="_blank">this Inc. article points out</a>, there are several hurdles to overcome when designing one. As someone who has a few under my belt, my key takeaways from the article were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit barriers to entry</li>
<li>Make entry steps clear and simple
<ul>
<li>Design as if your entrants were drunk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put in the promo work
<ul>
<li>Don’t leave it to chance</li>
<li>Make it easy and desirable to share results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make it worth it—follow up</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="How Are E-commerce Brands Using Quizzes to Drive 60% Conversion?" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/ecommerce-brands-using-quizzes-to-drive-conversion/" target="_blank">As we’ve discussed before</a>, quizzes are a perfect way to gather leads and customer data. Whereas you once used giveaways to bribe people into sharing information via a survey, quizzes allow you to ask for the same information, but in a fun, engaging, and immersive way. Pair a giveaway with that quiz and you won’t have a bucket big enough to hold all of the data hurled at you.</p>
<h3>How to Create a Giveaway Quiz</h3>
<p>Keep in mind what we learned from the Inc. article: when designing a quiz aimed at generating contest entries, you want to make things as simple—yet engaging—as possible. Ask fun questions to draw people in and make responding a breeze. We recommend using images instead of text whenever possible, as it decreases eyestrain and conveys so much more than words can (1,000X, if I recall).</p>
<p>At the end of a quiz, when you do ask for entry info—again, keep things as simple as possible—ideally one field for an email address. The best quiz creators think of creative ways to incorporate information gathering into their quiz instead of tacking it on the end. An example might be “Look out the window; what picture most resembles where you live?” followed by beautiful images of a beach, snowy mountain, lush thick forest, or open plains. The responses to this question may allow you to send personalized clothing recommendations or seasonal home improvement tips, and it sure beats requiring a field titled “City” and “State.” You can bet that the people entering your giveaway will prefer it.</p>
<h3>How to Promote a Giveaway Quiz</h3>
<p>The way you structure your results will go a long way towards how likely someone will be to share what they got, and thus promote your contest. Spend some time thinking about how you word your results. As with any quiz, the person is much more likely to share if they’re proud of the way they performed. Give them a solid pat on the back and they’ll put the word out, even if it means a slightly smaller chance they’ll win the prize themselves.</p>
<p>Make your quiz look nice—that will have an enormous impact on how well it does. Picture taking it yourself—does it look like a sloppy survey thrown together last minute, or is does it look like a million bucks? That may affect how likely people are to share their personal information with you.</p>
<p>Qzzr has designed a tool to make quizzes both simple and visually engaging. Here are a few examples of quizzes designed to promote contests and giveaways.</p>
<h4>Sideshow Collectibles</h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beginning immediately, foreign language speakers will notice Qzzr taking on a more international flavor. The quiz creator tool is now presented in several languages outside of the previous English default. Those taking quizzes will also see icons and messages reflecting their native tongues.</p>
<p>The change will be determined by the user’s browser language, as set in their Settings or Preferences. If your language is set to Spanish, you’ll see Spanish when you create a quiz.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spanish1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1460" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spanish1.png" alt="Spanish" width="650" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>The same will happen whether you build a quiz in German…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/German1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1461" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/German1.png" alt="German" width="650" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>…Italian….</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Italian.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1462" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Italian.png" alt="Italian" width="650" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>…or even Chinese.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chinese.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1463" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chinese.png" alt="Chinese" width="650" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>For those taking a quiz, where you once saw…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EuroSport-English1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1465" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EuroSport-English1.png" alt="EuroSport English" width="764" height="264" /></a></p>
<p>…you’ll now see…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EuroSport-French.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1466" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EuroSport-French.png" alt="EuroSport French" width="764" height="264" /></a></p>
<p>See the difference?</p>
<p>It’s important to note that you are still in control of how you write the questions. If your questions and answers are written in English, the person taking the quiz will see them in English, no matter what their browser settings say. The changes will be reflected in the icons and instructions seen throughout the quiz.</p>
<p>The list of available languages will be constantly evolving and growing to meet demand.</p>
<p>People all over the world are leveraging quizzes to drive social engagement, acquire leads, and present offers. These changes allow us to present a more robust experience for all, as we continue to see these things pop up all over the web.</p>
<p>So to you, non-English speakers, we tip our hats. If we could say that in Norwegian, we would.</p>
<p>Post any questions in the comments below. We&#8217;ll even try to answer in the corresponding language if we can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common question we get from people is, &#8220;What can I do with the &#8216;Description&#8217; underneath the question title when I&#8217;m making a quiz?&#8221;</p>
<p>To see what I&#8217;m talking about, take a look at the picture below:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1412" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.20.32-PM.png" alt="question description" width="600" height="453" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fun question to answer, because this might be my favorite feature in the quiz maker. I&#8217;m especially fond of uploading a picture into this section and asking a question about that image.</p>
<p>For instance, check out this question from this &#8220;<a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/can-you-beat-techradar-at-our-ultimate-smartphone-quiz--1284165" target="_blank">Can you name these classic mobile phones?</a>&#8221; quiz from TechRadar:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1413" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.16.53-PM.png" alt="mobile phone" width="600" height="599" /></p>
<p>They uploaded an image of a classic mobile phone, and the goal of the question is to see if people can name the model.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately on this question, &#8220;The Zack Morris Saved by the Bell phone&#8221; isn&#8217;t listed as an answer option.)</p>
<p>Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s another example from CollegeHumor&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6979812/quiz-game-of-thrones-or-creed-video" target="_blank">Game of Thrones Scene or Creed Music Video?</a>&#8221; quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1414" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.45.51-PM.png" alt="game of thrones creed" width="600" height="592" /></p>
<p>This quiz is so beautifully simple, and it&#8217;s everything you want out of a quiz. It&#8217;s visually appealing, easy-to-consume, and humorous.</p>
<p>Another way you can use the &#8220;Description&#8221; feature on the question title is to upload an image that contains your question. That way, you can use your own fonts and colors if you&#8217;d like. Here&#8217;s a question from Fanzz&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.fanzz.com/blog/new-england-patriot-past-present/" target="_blank">Which New England Patriot are you?</a>&#8221; quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1415" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.52.43-PM.png" alt="fanzz question" width="600" height="544" /></p>
<p>Thank goodness for our brilliant users who continue to amaze us with the creative ways they use Qzzr. If you have any other ideas for how to use this or any other feature on Qzzr, please let us know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to promoting your quizzes, Facebook can be your best friend. It is great for targeting, finding super-fans of quiz topics, and growing your customer base.</p>
<p>We’ve experimented with a variety of Facebook ads to help share awesome quizzes with the world and the results continue to amaze us. Here’s a quick overview of how to get the best results when you make a quiz and promote it on Facebook (or even an old quiz that you’d like to revive via Facebook).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Nail the initial post</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1344" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-9.07.21-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 9.07.21 AM" width="501" height="535" /></p>
<p>Start by getting the link to a quiz. Ideally, that link will be for a page from your own website that has the quiz embedded on it, but you can also use the Qzzr.com link if you don&#8217;t have it embedded anywhere.</p>
<p>Then, post that link to a Facebook post and make sure there is a published image. You can change the image by clicking on the change image button via Facebook but make sure it’s a clear description of what the quiz is and why it’s great.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your Facebook post is just like any other advertisement or marketing message you’ve ever worked with; it needs to be engaging, stand out, and have a call to action to really make it count.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Boost your post through Ads Manager</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve posted an update on Facebook, you’ll see the option to Boost your posts. This is a great way to improve engagement with any post and allows you very basic targeting options like posting to your fans, to a targeted group based on interests and set a budget.</p>
<p>For now let’s focus on doing this through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/advertising" target="_blank">Ads Manager</a> aspect of Facebook. That’s how you get your quiz in front of everyone and get the engagement your quiz deserves.</p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked on Create Ad in your Facebook ads manager you are given a number of advertising options. We recommend you focus on ‘Boost your posts’ which allows you to get engagement on your Facebook page AND your quiz. Win win.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1339" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-7.51.30-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 7.51.30 AM" width="380" height="404" /></p>
<p>You’ll then be given the option to choose which Facebook page (if you manage multiple pages) and which post you’d like to boost.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1340" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-7.53.43-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 7.53.43 AM" width="498" height="276" /></p>
<p>Next you are given the option to name your Campaign which is the highest level organizer in Facebook for your ads. A good option here is to replace the name that Facebook gives your campaign with the specific quiz you are working with. That way you can keep track on your Facebook boost success from the management page a lot more easily.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Target like a pro</strong></p>
<p>Once that’s done, you’ll be given all the targeting options (see below) which is where the magic happens. You can choose location targeting by country, region, state, city, etc. Or you can target by age, gender, language, interests, behaviors, and connections to your page or to fans of your page. This is also where you’ll be able to set a budget, timeframe for your promotion, and get an idea of the audience size you’ll be targeting. It can feel a little overwhelming at first, but remember, you can always just delete it. And you can’t screw anything up too badly from here, so take a deep breath and let’s go.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1341" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-7.56.12-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 7.56.12 AM" width="634" height="406" /></p>
<p>When you make a quiz, think about <strong>your quiz topic</strong> and think about <strong>your target customer/user</strong>. Facebook allows for so many targeting options that it’s important you remember both of these groups while setting up your targeting. The first thing is Locations. You can go as broad as a country or as specific as a city or zip code.</p>
<p>Next comes language. If you have an English quiz, you’ll want to call out English (ALL) in the language targeting options for Facebook. If your quiz is in any other language, simply pick that language in the targeting and you’re set. We haven&#8217;t done a lot of Age or Gender targeting unless the quiz or target customer really called for it, simply because the location and language allowed for a narrowed scope and there is a preference to let the quiz topic, title, and offer do the clarifying work.</p>
<p>Next comes Interests targeting which is where you can target Facebook users based on their interest in your quiz topic, offer, business, or anything else you can come up with. For example, if I’m selling a Breaking Bad character online and I’ve created a Breaking Bad quiz, I can target fans of Breaking Bad and Walter White. Here’s where you can do some exploring and potentially create a few different Ad Sets (<em>the level under Campaigns</em>) based on varying Interests targeting. In this section, you’ll also see potential audience size which is helpful for making sure you aren’t too narrowly focused.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1342" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-8.02.14-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 8.02.14 AM" width="564" height="165" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Set your budget</strong></p>
<p>Another fantastic part to Facebook ads has been the small amount of money you can use to get started. Setting a daily budget or a Campaign budget allows any company of any size to try it. The recommendation here is to trust in Facebook’s ability to make the most of your marketing dollars by using the Pricing optimization option of ‘Get the most engagements..’. Facebook does a great job of getting you the most bang for your buck&#8230;usually.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1343" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-8.16.31-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 8.16.31 AM" width="628" height="339" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Pick the on-screen location where your quiz will show up on people&#8217;s feeds</strong></p>
<p>Finally you get to pick where your quiz shows up. We’ve found great success by removing the Right Column ads for targeting, but everything is worth trying if you feel differently. Desktop News Feed and Mobile News Feed are the perfect place for your quiz to show up. This is where you can get an idea for what your ad will look like on Facebook (make sure your spelling is correct). Then click Publish Ad.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Most people know about quizzes because they&#8217;ve seen them on their own Facebook feeds. They consistently top the charts of the most shared pieces of content on Facebook, and it doesn&#8217;t appear to be slowing down any time soon.</p>
<p>In short, Facebook is an ideal starting point for promoting your quiz. And by using the tips laid out above, you can increase engagement at an extremely cheap price – we&#8217;ve seen rates as low as $0.01 per post engagement.</p>
<p>Having said that, the book is still being written. I&#8217;m always open to new ideas about promoting quizzes on Facebook, and here are a few more valuable resources if you’re looking to kick your Facebook marketing up a level:</p>

<p>Some of the most popular quizzes on all of Qzzr are graded quizzes (often referred to as trivia quizzes). People just love to prove how much they know about <a href="http://www.carthrottle.com/post/how-much-of-a-petrolhead-are-you-really-70-per-cent-means-youre-doing-well/" target="_blank">cars</a>, <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/do-you-really-know-star-wars/" target="_blank">Star Wars</a>, the <a href="http://www.mrctv.org/blog/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-constitution" target="_blank">U.S. Constitution</a>, or the <a href="http://www.dorkly.com/post/69388/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-pokemon-theme-song" target="_blank">Pokemon theme song</a>.</p>
<p>You can create a graded quiz about anything from advanced biology to the latest season of <em>Real Housewives of Atlanta</em>. We have even seen someone create a graded quiz for a bachelorette party to quiz people&#8217;s knowledge of the future bride&#8217;s life and interests.</p>
