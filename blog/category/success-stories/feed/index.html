				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bill_Belichick.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1448" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bill_Belichick.jpg" alt="New England Patriots at Washington Redskins 08/28/09" width="900" height="680" /></a></p>
<p>You like sports, right?</p>
<p>Well, if you do, you’ll be interested in these quizzes. If not, you may still get a lot out of them. They certainly seem to attract more fans than One Direction at a middle school assembly. Combined, they have been taken nearly half a million times.</p>
<p>In no particular order, here are five of our top sports quizzes.</p>
<h4>Sports Illustrated: <a href="http://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/01/20/guess-real-bill-belichick-quote" target="_blank">What Would Bill Belichick Say?</a></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;ve watched any interviews with Bill Belichick, you&#8217;ll notice that the man keeps things close to the vest. Interviews with him tend to be &#8211; how should we say &#8211; less than revealing.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="33995"></div>
<h4><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script><br />
espnW: <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11128656/espnw-cheering-wrong-world-cup-team" target="_blank">What World Cup Team Are You?</a></h4>
<p>Yes, the World Cup was a year ago. No, we aren&#8217;t going to let that get in the way of finding out which team we most identify with. One piece of advice: open yourself up to the possibility that it may not be who you think it will. </p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="8331"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>EuroSport: <a href="http://lebuzz.eurosport.fr/football/quiz-quelle-star-du-foot-etes-vous-13501/" target="_blank">Quelle Star du Foot Êtes-Vous?</a></h4>
<p>Google Translate and three months in French-speaking Africa helped me figure out that this quiz is asking &#8220;Which Football Star Are You?&#8221; and that it&#8217;s been taken over 250,000 times. Aside from that, I&#8217;m lost.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="48467"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script>One interesting thing about this &#8211; over the past few months, we have been working hard to translate the Qzzr experience into foreign languages, including Spanish, French, Chinese, and more. This means it&#8217;s easier and easier for people throughout the world to create simple, elegant quizzes to drive social traffic and generate leads. Look for more on this in coming weeks. </p>
<h4>Squakwa: <a href="http://www.squawka.com/news/quiz-which-top-football-manager-are-you/281274" target="_blank">Which Top Football Manager Are You?</a></h4>
<p>Spoiler alert: We&#8217;re not bringing Belichick back into the mix. This quiz relates to the football that the other 95% of the world plays. </p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="34817"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>College Humor: <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6988585/quiz-nfl-player-or-key-peele-character" target="_blank">NFL Player or Key &amp; Peele Character?</a></h4>
<p>College Humor is always good for a funny quiz, and this one does not disappoint. While not directly sports-related, it does shine a humorous light on some of the harder-to-pronounce players&#8217; names in the NFL.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="15802"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>No matter the subject, it&#8217;s clear that quizzes have the ability to engage an audience. Whether your goal is to increase your brand&#8217;s social engagement on Facebook or increase the amount of fun at your high school reunion, a quiz might be just the thing for you.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for determining which Frozen character I am, or finding out how well I know Armenian pop songs from the 80s. In fact, I consider these basic human needs—equal in importance to food, water, and shelter.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1446  alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shopping-cart-294547_640-300x284.png" alt="shopping-cart-294547_640" width="273" height="258" />Nonetheless, the value of quizzes can extend past this. In particular, many top brands have been realizing incredible ecommerce conversion rates by incorporating quizzes into their content strategies.</p>
<p>How do they do this? Like any good marketing effort, it begins with a goal. Of course, while the ultimate objective of any ecommerce company is found in the latter part of that word—commerce—a successful company will break this down into smaller, more easily measured and influenced metrics. Examples may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand awareness/recognition</li>
<li>Web traffic</li>
<li>Email subscriptions</li>
<li>Data acquisition</li>
<li>Revenue</li>
<li>Decreased bounce rate</li>
<li>Improved organic search</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at five brands in particular, and how quizzes are helping them bring home the bacon.</p>
<h4>Zenni Optical</h4>
<p><a title="UPDATE: The Quiz That Has Generated Over $250,000" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/update-quiz-generated-250000/" target="_blank">We’ve spoken about these guys before</a>, but when it comes to ecommerce success, they’re the crown jewel. To date, their <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank"><em>You’ve Been Framed</em> quiz</a> has been taken over 415,000 times, generated over 23,000 leads, and has generated nearly $400,000 in revenue. And the best part is that the thing&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; conifer – as evergreen as green can be. They&#8217;ve long stopped promoting it, but it keeps churning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Zenni-Optical-Conversion.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1445" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Zenni-Optical-Conversion.png" alt="Zenni Optical Conversion" width="1028" height="118" /></a></p>
<p>We’ll give this some more detail as we go along, but one of the secrets to this quiz’s success is its role as a decision engine. It takes a difficult scenario – selecting the right eyeglass frame for your style, features, activity level, etc. – and asks simple questions to determine the best fit. True – they could&#8217;ve spelled it all out in a longform blog post or infographic, but they didn’t. The quiz draws people in and helps resolve one of the top obstacles causing bounce rate. This in turn drives revenue. And the result has been astounding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Qzzr-Zenni-New-Page-3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1442" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Qzzr-Zenni-New-Page-3.png" alt="Qzzr - Zenni - New Page (3)" width="1140" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Update 6/2/15: This quiz has now generated more than 31,000 new leads and over $1 million in revenue. Incredible!</em></strong></p>
<h4>Sideshow Collectibles</h4>
<p>When figurine studio Sideshow Collectibles was faced with the challenge of launching a new lineup, they <a href="http://courtofthedead.com/which-court-of-the-dead-faction-are-you/" target="_blank">created a quiz to sort fans into various factions</a> integral to the overarching story, Court of the Dead. At the end of the quiz, people were presented with a coupon and an opportunity to win a limited edition figurine from the collection.</p>
<p>The result was astounding. Of the nearly 37,000 people that took the quiz, Sideshow Collectibles generated over 22,000 leads. That’s a 60% ecommerce conversion rate(!), which as of October had directly prompted over 1,800 orders and more than $75,000 in sales.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Court-of-the-Dead-Conversion.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1436" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Court-of-the-Dead-Conversion-1024x116.png" alt="Court of the Dead Conversion" width="1024" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>As if that was not enough, by using the questions they did, they had acquired invaluable amounts of data about those subscribers in a way that would allow targeted marketing automation down the road. As far as quiz strategy goes, <a href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/content/18981.html" target="_blank">this case study is the cream of the crop</a>.</p>
<h4>Lime Ricki</h4>
<p>Like Zenni Optical, this modest swimwear brand is <a href="http://blog.limericki.com/what-swimsuit-suits-you-quiz/" target="_blank">using the power or quizzes as a decision engine</a>. By addressing and eliminating one of the largest obstacles in their customers’ minds – indecision or self-consciousness about the style or fit of a swimsuit – they’ve increased web traffic, sales and email subscriptions.</p>
<p>In addition, the success of this quiz proves potential for quizzes to serve a sales/support role for ecommerce brands. Instead of occupying a salesperson’s time to get recommendations, the quiz is able to direct them to products that fit their body type, interests, color preferences, and more.</p>
<h4>Kettlebell Fever</h4>
<p>It can be easy to get overwhelmed by stories of the big brands, with marketing campaigns blowing past 300,000 leads or more. But it’s important to note that the concept remains the same for small businesses. A perfect example of this is a fitness company called Kettlebell Fever. Their quiz has been taken 549 times, bringing in 100 leads. An 18% ecommerce conversion rate was a big deal for them, and ended up being a nice revenue tick.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-08-at-1.41.41-PM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1443 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-08-at-1.41.41-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="118" /></a></p>
<h4>Pampadour</h4>
<p>Another great example of this came from <a href="http://blog.pampadour.com/beauty-addict-game-hosted-pampadour/" target="_blank">Pampadour</a>, a Pinterest-style network for those wanting to share beauty products and techniques. In trying to expand their blog’s reach, they launched a quiz—paired with a giveaway—that netted them 163 leads, with a 52% conversion rate. That goes a long way in the early days of a blog, as does landing customer data that will allow systematic, interest-based marketing automation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pampadour-Conversion.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1438" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pampadour-Conversion-1024x116.png" alt="Pampadour Conversion" width="1024" height="116" /></a></p>
<h4>Wrap-Up</h4>
<p>In the world of marketing, few tactics bring in those conversion rates. You may be skeptical <a title="Why Quizzes? Confessions of a Marketer Not Yet Drunk on Quiz Koolaid" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/why-quizzes-marketer/" target="_blank">(and I was, too)</a>, but <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/pricing/" target="_blank">give it a try</a> and see what happens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/quiz-generated-124000-revenue-counting/" target="_blank">I told you</a> about a quiz that had generated over $124,000 in revenue for an eyewear company called Zenni Optical. Here is what I said at the time:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>This quiz has been taken more than 140,000 times, but that’s not even the best part. Zenni was able to capture 7,000 email addresses, and the quiz helped generate $124,000 in revenue (<strong>and counting</strong>).</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out that quiz had A LOT of counting left to do.</p>
<p>I just talked to one of the people who helped create that quiz, and he said the quiz was still a gold mine. It has now been taken over 300,000 times, generated <strong>more than 16,000 new leads, </strong>and<strong> </strong>produced <strong>$259,496.20 in revenue</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a <strong>quarter million dollars</strong> off of one quiz.</p>
<p>You can see this quiz for yourself here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/f094ba79-35f3-4df3-90c2-bc7e502466e3.png" alt="zenni frames quiz" width="460" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>And guess what? It’s not done yet. I can’t wait to follow up with them in a couple months to get an update on how the quiz is doing.</p>
<p>Nothing makes us happier than seeing our users get out-of-this-world results with their quizzes. Whether your quiz generates over a quarter million dollars or entertains your family at a reunion, we’re here to celebrate all of your victories.</p>
