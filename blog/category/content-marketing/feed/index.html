				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you too have been infected by the TV show Suits, you’ll recognize these all-too-common progressive symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch one episode of Suits</li>
<li>Obsess about Suits</li>
<li>Develop unsettling, yet secure man/woman-crush on Harvey Specter</li>
<li>Glance at your watch to realize it’s 4AM and you have a meeting in four hours</li>
<li>Watch one more episode</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve caught much of the show, you’ll know that Harvey is the kind of guy that says the exact right thing at the exact right time.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking, isn’t that exactly what I try to do as a content creator? <span id="more-1756"></span>And isn’t that commonality enough to create a lasting friendship that could include regular recreational activities together, like—I don’t know—driving cool cars, trying on <img class="  wp-image-1758 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NUP_143654_1381.jpg" alt="NUP_143654_1381.tif" width="369" height="208" />expensive suits, messing with Louis…</p>
<p>FOCUS, Coy! Sorry, back to my point. Harvey got where he is for a reason (and no, that’s not just because someone wrote that into a script). So I pulled the ten best Harvey Specter quotes and packaged them here for your content marketing enlightenment.</p>
<h3>The Top 10 Best Harvey Specter Quotes on Content Marketing</h3>
<h4>&#8220;I don&#8217;t pave the way for people&#8230; People pave the way for me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Success and innovation almost always go together, so move early and move fast. If you’re standing still, you’ll likely get passed over or lost in the fray. <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/23/attention-economy" target="_blank">There’s a finite amount of attention out there</a>, so only the most unique, best produced content even has a shot at being seen. Is Harvey the kind of guy that would throw together a sloppy blog post? Are you serious? I oughta slap you for even considering it.</p>
<h4>“I don’t play the odds, I play the man.”</h4>
<p>You didn’t know Harvey was into personalized marketing, did you? If there’s one thing you know about Harvey and Mike Ross, it’s that every situation and case is tirelessly researched. They don&#8217;t go into any scenario blindly (with a few disastrous exceptions), and eventually it’s a silver bullet of uncovered information that makes the difference.</p>
<p>Find out what makes your customer tick, then give them what they want—even if they themselves don’t know it yet.</p>
<h4>“That&#8217;s the difference between you and me—you wanna lose small, I wanna win big”</h4>
<p>Win big by finding out what works and then go in for the jugular. How do you do this? Research and testing, my friend.</p>
<p>Do those take time? Absolutely. Are they pleasant? Not always. But do they pay off? In spades. One example showed that testing even just the copy on a button <a href="http://copyhackers.com/2014/09/buttons-vs-headlines/" target="_blank">resulted in a 123% improvement</a> on clickthrough rate. I’d call that winning big, wouldn’t you?</p>
<h4>“It’s not bragging if it’s true.”</h4>
<p>Stop waiting for other people to talk about your successes—it may not happen. Potential customers need to know why they should give their time and money to you, and if they can’t find a reason, they’re gone. If you haven’t noticed, Harvey is not afraid to point out the fact that he’s the best, and I can’t remember one example of a client leaving to another firm (and staying there—if I’m wrong, let me know in the comments).</p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean you have to be insufferable about it, as Harvey occasionally is. While confidence and bravado are celebrated characteristics in high-powered NYC corporate law, you may not be able to get away with it in your space. Tout your strengths and showcase your wins, but do so tactfully.</p>
<p>And what’s even better than shouting your own praises? Having someone else tout them for you. A pleased-as-punch customer of ours recently wrote a guest post on the Uberflip blog, detailing the quiz they created, how they promoted it, and how it has <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/95454123-how-one-quiz-generated-a-million-dollars" target="_blank">generated over $1.1 million in revenue</a>.</p>
<h4>&#8220;Loyalty is a two way street. If I&#8217;m asking for it from you, then you are getting it from me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Love this one. It speaks to the symbiotic nature of companies and customers. As marketers, there is no greater goal than earning loyal customers—the kind that keep coming back time and again. However, as consumers, we value the types of businesses that listen and move to meet customer requests. It’s a complex dance in which neither party can become complacent or stationary, and every touch point is a new opportunity to strengthen or weaken that relationship.</p>
<h4>“I don’t have dreams—I have goals.”</h4>
<p>Dreams are what you spend hours thinking about, and goals are what you work tirelessly to achieve. How do you set the right kind of powerful, challenging goals? One great formula is that of <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/How-to-Set-SMART-Marketing-Goals-for-2013-TEMPLATE.aspx" target="_blank">SMART goals</a>, which says that goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Bound.</p>
<p>As an example, we set a goal in May to double the amount of <a href="http://go.qzzr.com/ebook-are-you-a-qwizard/?utm_campaign=qwizardebook&amp;utm_source=suits&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank">“Are You a Qwizard?” ebook</a> downloads, and then rolled out some new strategies to promote it. We ended up with more than a 295% increase in May, so we learned a lot about what was realistic.</p>
<h4>“I don&#8217;t get lucky. I make my own luck.&#8221;</h4>
<p>The man makes his own luck, ladies and gentlemen. Spectacular.</p>
<p>But that’s not altogether impossible. In sports, luck is thrown around a lot. “That shot was lucky” or “They got lucky” or “That was a lucky break.” Well, a lot of hard work and preparation goes into getting to the point where luck can enter into the equation.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors hadn’t done anything much more than yawn-worthy in more than 20 years. But try and tell Steph Curry that their NBA title was lucky.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="max-width: 100%;" src="//giphy.com/embed/laEnlnMj27drW" width="480" height="269" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Suits doesn’t usually do much more than allude to the hours of research and discovery that goes into their cases (if they showed it, it would be more like CSPAN, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we</span> nobody would watch it). While it’s true that you can catch a lucky break from time to time, if you’re relying on those moments to carry your marketing performance, you’re not going to last long.</p>
<h4>&#8220;The only time ‘success’ comes before ‘work’ is in the dictionary.”</h4>
<p>See above.</p>
<p>Man, Harvey can say pretty much the same thing and it still sounds so cool.</p>
<h4>“Anyone can do my job, but no one can be me.”</h4>
<p>Be irreplaceable. There are more than a million people in the US with the exact same degree, but only Harvey can be Harvey. Again, I’m aware that it’s a fictional program—but you and I both know people that have the same degree or experience that we do, but have been able to parlay that into mountainous success.</p>
<p>Look at this from a branding perspective, whether that’s from a corporate or personal standpoint. Being human is a good thing, and being yourself is even better. Brands that successfully humanize their voice enjoy more success on social media, and that translates into improved performance overall. <a href="https://moz.com/blog/4-ways-to-build-trust-and-humanize-your-brand" target="_blank">Moz has a phenomenal guide</a> to humanizing your brand.</p>
