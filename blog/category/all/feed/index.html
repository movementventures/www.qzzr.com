<p>Independence Day is this weekend and—between backyard barbecues and firework shows—many individuals will be sitting back and enjoying some free time. And what do we do when we’ve got an afternoon to waste? We get on the Internet.</p>
<p>You will see all walks of life posting to your favorite social media channel during the Fourth of July weekend. Between uploading family photos and researching the perfect fried chicken recipe, everyone is bound to skim through Facebook to peek into the lives of everyone else they know.</p>
<p>Capitalize on this social media mayhem by posting the perfect, engaging US history quiz. You will need to find a balance between holiday fun and industry relevance, but if you walk that line just right, your engagement is sure to spike.<span id="more-1766"></span></p>
<p>Need some help getting started? Here is a list of conversation-starting, thought-provoking Independence Day quiz ideas that will capture your proud customers on everyone’s favorite summer weekend!</p>
<h3>1. How Much Do You Know About US History in Pop Culture?</h3>
<p>Everyone loves a bit of pop-culture trivia. Capture audiences young and old with this engaging quiz idea where everyone can participate. Where does Independence Day appear in iconic films? Which books have used Independence Day in the plot? Get families talking about their favorite cultural stars and recommending must-see movies after a few fun questions. This taxing US history quiz is bound to dominate social media with its shareable facts and goading headline.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which Star Trek character quotes the Preamble in episode 52 of the original series, “The Omega Glory?” A: Captain Kirk</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3b56e0u0EgQ" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>2. Which Founding Father Are You?</h3>
<p>This quiz headline isn’t particularly unique, but it is catchy. In fact, as I was researching this quiz idea, I found myself taking one of the many founding father quizzes out there. In case you were wondering, I’m Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a quiz doesn’t need to be one-of-a-kind, it just needs to be memorable and timely. And what is more relevant and shareable than a personality quiz that makes people feel proud to be an American?</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>One question I thought was funny from the quiz I took was:</p>
<p>Q: How tall are you?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Fairly tall</li>
<li>Fairly short</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too old to care</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too busy fighting duels to measure</li>
</ol>
<p>(Take the quiz and share your results with us in the comments!)</p>
<h3>3. Is This Tradition From the United States or Britain?</h3>
<p>Inspire the proud American in everyone on Independence Day with a quiz that highlights the differences between the United States and our motherland. You can look at how the two countries have changed, the silly laws we kept and changed over the years, the differences in holiday traditions, and any other funny facts that will interest quiz takers. Here are some examples.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which country participates in “worm charming” to collect bait for fishing? A: <a href="http://listverse.com/2010/04/02/10-very-strange-british-traditions/" target="_blank">Britain</a>: The competition was initiated by local man Tom Shufflebotham who on July 5, 1980, charmed 511 worms from the ground in only half an hour. The game has been held every year since as a world championship. The competition has 18 rules. Music of any kind can be used to charm worms out of the ground, but no drugs can be used. Water is considered to be a drug.</p>
<p>Q: Which country uses more pumpkins to celebrate Halloween each year? A: <a href="http://www.anglotopia.net/british-identity/lost-pond-5-major-differences-english-american-halloween-traditions/" target="_blank">The United States</a>: Illinois alone uses around 500 million a year, the UK uses about 4 million a year in total.</p>
<h3>4. How Many Americans Are Actually American?</h3>
<p>Ever wondered how American you really are? The United States has long been dubbed a melting pot for different cultures, and the actual breakdown of where today’s population originated from is interesting, and sometimes shocking. Remind quiz takers of their origins and perhaps inspire people to appreciate their culture and this great country in which we live.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: True or False? Research has found that more than 6 million Americans who self-identify as European likely carry African ancestry. A: <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/21/americans-mixed-ancestry/" target="_blank">True</a>: A study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics found this to be true, and that as many as 5 million self-described European Americans might have at least 1 percent Native American ancestry as well.</p>
<h3>5. Lies US History Taught Us: Are You Smarter Than James Loewen?</h3>
<p>Want a little controversy? This time of year, we like to pull out facts from our arsenal of American history—but how much history do we really know? The bestselling book written by James Loewen in 1995, called Lies My Teacher Told Me, outlines a number of inaccuracies in our most popular history textbooks, particularly about the settling of the United States and the idealization of national heroes. Test your followers’ US history knowledge with interesting facts and ideas inspired by Loewen. You’ll give quiz takers some food for thought and establish yourself as an edgy, knowledgeable source.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: According to Lies My Teacher Told Me, how much more do American clothing workers make than their Malaysian counterparts? A: <a href="https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/loewen.html" target="_blank">1,500 times more</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Holidays are a great time to take advantage of the social engagement that quizzes offer. Take advantage of your potential customers’ free time and grab their attention with something funny, interesting or controversial, but always shareable.</p>
<p>Happy Independence Day!</p>
<p>Want some inspiration? Here&#8217;s a great US history quiz that has been taken over 140,000 times!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Producing quality content—whether it be on a blog or otherwise—works.</p>
<p>Study after study confirms this fact, but just for good measure, <a href="http://marketeer.kapost.com/content-strategy-2015/#axzz3bGGrNAYU">let’s hit a few up once again</a>:<span id="more-1745"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>B2B companies that blog generate 67% more leads than those that don’t.</li>
<li>72% of marketers feel that branded content is more effective than magazine advertisements.</li>
<li>Interactive content—apps, assessments, calculators, and quizzes—generates conversions moderately or very well 70% of the time, compared to 36% of the time with passive content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem arises in producing the kind of content that will resonate with an increasingly discerning public. There’s this weird phenomenon going on, where people are becoming more burned out with poorly produced “fluff” content, while searching ravenously for well-written, topical content.</p>
<p>So how do you land squarely in the latter camp—where potential customers will flock to your brand to consume, ask questions, add feedback and comments, and willingly offer up personal information in an attempt to tap into your ever-flowing nozzle of learning?</p>
<p>Recently, we had a great webinar with Skip Besthoff of InboundWriter. There was some fascinating conversation around the need for both traffic and engagement, and how to drive both.</p>
<p>We’ll embed the full video and slides at the bottom of this post, but in the meantime, here are a few tidbits of that conversation to get you pointed in the right direction:</p>
<h3>The 80/20 rule</h3>
<p>As a general rule, around 20% of your content will drive 80% of your traffic.</p>
<p>But why is this? What makes those posts so alluring? And how can you write your other posts in that vein?</p>
<p>Ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my largest source of traffic? (which specific campaign, article, etc?)</li>
<li>Which traffic converts the best?</li>
<li>Are certain types of visitors more engaged than others? Why?</li>
<li>Does engagement yield more conversions/leads?</li>
<li>What can I do to improve engagement?</li>
<li>Where should I invest resources for more traffic?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constant traffic and engagement</h3>
<p>Here’s what traffic to the average blog post will look like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.33.46-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1746" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.33.46-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-17 at 1.33.46 AM" width="1093" height="422" /></a></p>
<p>In contrast, when a post has been analytically conceived and thoughtfully written with clear engagement cues and calls to action, along with an aggressive promotion strategy, your traffic will likely begin to look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.34.07-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.34.07-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-17 at 1.34.07 AM" width="1048" height="416" /></a></p>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>As far as successful content marketing, quizzes are at the top of the world right now. Here are a few stats <a title="6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz (and How to Make It Viral) [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/">we got from our friends at Buzzsumo</a>:</p>
<p>Quizzes have a…</p>
<ul>
<li><del></del>81% completion rate</li>
<li>2:27 average completion time</li>
<li>5% lead conversion rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s pretty extraordinary, especially since those are average numbers. Competent marketers that really take their jobs seriously may exceed those figures. Seriously.</p>
<h3>Full webinar</h3>
<p>These are just a few points we pulled from the webinar. If you’d like to watch it in its entirety, the video is below. Likewise, the slides are embedded as well.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your best content falls in the woods, does it have any value?</p>
<p>It does you little good to create the best content on Earth if no one is going to find it. So we wanted to come up with a go-to promotion strategy for marketing quizzes and other forms of interactive content. <span id="more-1709"></span></p>
<p>We’ve taught you <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to create great content</a>, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">how to find images</a> for it, and even <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/guide-for-global-quiz-domination/" target="_blank">how to use it to take over the world</a>. So what’s the next step? Spreading the word, obviously. You’re smart, you know the basics—stick it on Facebook and Twitter, put it on your blog, send it out through your newsletter. But what about the secrets, the things that set masters apart from amateurs? Well, that’s what we’re here for. We&#8217;ve picked up a few promotion strategy tricks along the way, and would love to share them with you.</p>
<p>First, a disclaimer: depending on who your customer or market is, your promotion strategy will be different. Not everything in this post will work for everyone, so instead of offering a to-do list, we offer this list as a toolbox, letting you choose your own tools for the job at hand.</p>
<p>Now that that’s over, let us introduce you to your new go-to resources for content promotion strategy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1712 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png" alt="1" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Have awesome content</h3>
<p>The first step, albeit obvious, must be stated: promoting content rests on the prerequisite of having content that’s worth promoting. What makes that? Good ideas, eye-catching headlines, captivating images. You’re already salivating just thinking about it, we know. And if you’re planning on using a quiz or two, check out our tips on <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to make it sweet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1713 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png" alt="2" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Use who you know</h3>
<p>Take advantage of the people that already know you and like you. Not in a bad way, more in a you-liked-that-one-thing-so-let-me-show-you-something-kind-of-like-it type of way. This means any way your brand has of reaching customers, like social media, newsletters, and blogs.</p>
<p>Anywhere you have an audience that’s already shown they’re interested in what you have to say, put your content there! Since newsletter subscribers and blog viewers are fairly self-explanatory, we’ll focus mainly on how to reach your social followers. It doesn’t matter which social media platform you use most—whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, or Pinterest—something here applies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1711 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png" alt="3" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h4>Post it!</h4>
<p>Once it goes live, make sure it goes out. On sites that allow it, use hashtags that work well in your industry; you can find them using sites like <a href="hashtagify.me" target="_blank">hashtagify.me</a> and check their effectiveness with <a href="ritetag.com" target="_blank">Rite Tag</a>. Tag the inspiration for your content or anyone you feature (we’ll talk more about this later).</p>
<h4>Post it again&#8230;and again</h4>
<p>When the internet gets over 9,000 new tweets and 2,000 new Instagram photos per second, how do you get your posts noticed? The easy solution is to post more. Here’s a few tips straight out of the Qzzr playbook:</p>
<p>Twitter: On publish, 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months<br />
Facebook: On publish, 3 days, 1 week<br />
LinkedIn: On publish, 1 week<br />
Google Plus: On publish, 1 week</p>
<p>We know what you’re thinking though: what if your followers get annoyed? Guy Kawasaki doesn&#8217;t think so—in <a title="Guy Kawasaki’s 12-Part Social Media Strategy Template" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/guy-kawasaki-social-media-strategy-template/" target="_blank">a recent webinar </a>we did with him, <strong>he asserted that the potential for a few lost followers is well worth the risk</strong>.</p>
<p>However, facing that risk head-on may be more than you can handle. One trick is to present something different with each post, a tidbit that educates anyone who reads it, whether or not they click on your link. Never post the exact same thing twice. A few ways to introduce that variety:</p>
<p><strong>Tweet the title</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz (and How to Make it Viral)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pose a question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Of all the forms of content out there, why should you use quizzes and how do you make a killer one?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote an author</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to make it viral: get five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher to share it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cite a statistic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know: The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mention influencer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BuzzSumo’s Stephen Walsh paired up with Qzzr to talk quiz tactics, analytics, and stats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make a bold, attention-grabbing statement (that would double as a title)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t fall behind! How to join the content revolution with quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post a link</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post a photo</strong></p>
<h4>Time it right</h4>
<p>But what’s the use of posting and posting again if no one sees it? You have to post when the most people are online.</p>
<p>To schedule, use something like <a href="hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite </a>or <a href="www.tweetdeck.com" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a>. For ideas about optimal posting times, here’s what we’ve picked up in our adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>More posts/day = more engagement</li>
<li>Most blog post shares happen on Thursday</li>
<li>For the most Facebook clicks, post at 1:00pm or 3:00pm on Thursday or Friday—for the most shares, post Saturday afternoon</li>
<li>For Twitter, 5:00pm weekdays or anytime weekends is best</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pin it</h4>
<p>You’re probably thinking Pinterest, but you can pin posts in Twitter too (in Facebook, it’s called highlighting). This means anyone who looks at your profile will see these posts first.</p>
<h4>Feature your image</h4>
<p>Pinterest &amp; Instagram are image-based websites, but that doesn’t mean you should neglect photos on your other accounts. Facebook thinks posts with photos are more “important,” which makes them more likely to appear in newsfeeds, and a tweet with an image is much more noticeable than all-text.</p>
<p>We like using stock photos under the Creative Commons license (you can find photos <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">at these websites</a>) and then editing them using <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>.</p>
<h4>Post in groups</h4>
<p>If your business is B2B or if content is directed to a very niche community, posting to groups is essential. Find Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, and Google+ communities whose members would benefit from what you’re posting. Here at Qzzr, we usually try to find two or three groups on each website that are relevant.</p>
<h4>Expand your reach</h4>
<p>Last but not least, you can always draw more eyes by paying for views, if you’re so inclined. The great thing about this is the control you have over who you’re targeting—people who are similar to your current audience, age range, demographic, etc.</p>
<h3>Find people who want to know you</h3>
<p>If you have valuable content (and of course you do), it&#8217;ll mean something to others as well. So your job is to seek out these others and let them spread your words and images to other people in the industry as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1714 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png" alt="promotion post" width="900" height="900" /></a></p>
<h4>Bloggers &amp; influencers</h4>
<p>Find the bloggers and influencers who write about your topic and find your content valuable. But remember: someone needs a reason to read, retweet, or recommend whatever it is you send them—and sometimes, they even need a reason to open the email you send them. As Alex Turnbull, the founder of Groove, <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/1000-subscribers" target="_blank">quotes</a>, “No one cares about your content unless they care about you.”</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a catch-22: how do you make people care about your content if you don’t email them? But why would they open your emails if they don’t care about you? The secret is to start building the relationship and the conversation before you need it. Start interacting with influencers by commenting thoughtfully on their posts, retweeting their content, and then emailing them personally after they&#8217;ve seen your name and responded a few times. It’s time consuming but it’s definitely worth it.</p>
<p>You can find bloggers or influencers (people with big followings who share content similar to yours) through any of several sites. Some focus on different social platforms, and others, like BuzzSumo, are multi-purpose—you can find bloggers and Twitter influencers.</p>
<p><a href="http://BuzzSumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Topsy.com" target="_blank">Topsy.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Alltop.com" target="_blank">Alltop.com</a><br />
<a href="http://WeFollow.com" target="_blank">WeFollow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Twellow.com" target="_blank">Twellow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://CircleCount.com" target="_blank">CircleCount.com</a></p>
<h4>Blogger communities</h4>
<p>Similar but sometimes more effective (results will vary), you can also submit your article to mass communities of bloggers like:</p>
<p><a href="http://triberr.com/pages/stream.php" target="_blank">Triberr</a><br />
<a href="http://www.socialbuzzclub.com/" target="_blank">Social Buzz Club</a><br />
<a href="http://bizbloggingbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Biz Blogging Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://viralcontentbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Viral Content Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://www.justretweet.com/" target="_blank">Just Retweet</a><br />
<a href="https://izea.com/" target="_blank">Izea</a></p>
<p>Izea is a site that doesn’t really fit in this category because it functions differently. It’s a paid service where brands can find and pay social media content creators to feature their products/content. It worked well for Zenni Optical (made them <a title="The Anatomy of the Million Dollar Quiz [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/million-dollar-quiz-revenue/" target="_blank">over $1 million!</a>).</p>
<h4>Link roundups</h4>
<p>Link roundups are another way to get your content out there. Many bloggers send out daily or weekly newsletters with a list of their favorite articles or links around the web. For example, <a href="https://mattermark.com/category/mattermark-daily/">Mattermark</a> and <a href="http://foundcy.com/">Foundcy</a> do this with startup-related content. Google something like “link roundup” or “weekly link roundup” along with a category name, and email the organizer.</p>
<h4>Forums and submissions</h4>
<p>Submit post to relevant chains. Find a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">reddit</a> that’s similar to what you do. Or, if you&#8217;re in a very popular or large industry like startups or tech, you can submit to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a> for tech or <a href="http://inbound.org/">Inbound.org</a> and <a href="https://growthhackers.com/">Growth Hackers</a> for marketing. Forums are also a good niche place to send your content to—just find ones that apply to you and are made up of audiences that would find value in what you post. And just like with bloggers and influencers, it&#8217;s best to have a good standing within the group before you start posting.</p>
<h3>Put yourself out there</h3>
<p>Curation and aggregation get confused a lot. The easiest way to distinguish the two? Aggregation is usually automatic or, at least, not filtered based on any standard of quality, just amassed by keywords. Curated content is manually selected by someone and usually republished by that person with fresh insights, a new headline, or personal commentary. In other words, aggregation is collecting, while curation is choosing what&#8217;s in that collection. Both are great for submitting to to expose a wider audience to what you&#8217;re writing or making.</p>
<h4>Content curation platforms</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of popular content curation platforms across the web. (We debated keeping <a href="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis/confirm">Digg</a> on the list, but it seems to have passed its hey-day. No harm in submitting there anyways though, right?)</p>
<p><a href="stumbleupon.com" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a><br />
<a href="http://www.scoop.it/" target="_blank">Scoop.it</a><br />
<a href="http://paper.li/" target="_blank">Paper.li</a><br />
<a href="https://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a></p>
<p>The website that we&#8217;re most familiar with on the list is StumbleUpon, so we&#8217;ll stick with giving you advice on that one. First, you submit the page by logging into your StumbleUpon account. Stumblers love things like videos, tutorials, infographics, images, and lists. Interactive is even better—quizzes, anyone? If you&#8217;re serious about getting &#8220;stumbles,&#8221; add a StumbleUpon badge to your page to increase organic traffic, and share StumbleUpon&#8217;s custom URL on your social media. Lastly, you can track analytics—the views and likes on your submitted piece—by clicking on the &#8220;Your Likes&#8221; portion of your profile.</p>
<h4>Content aggregators</h4>
<p>Here are a few aggregators that cover different topics. Same as the curation platforms, most of them require you to create an account before submitting content.</p>
<p><a href="alltop.com" target="_blank">AllTop.com</a><br />
<a href="affposts.com" target="_blank">AffPosts.com</a><br />
<a href="affbuzz.com" target="_blank">AffBuzz.com</a><br />
<a href="affdaily.com" target="_blank">AffDaily.com</a></p>
<h3>Get discovered</h3>
<p>Content discovery/syndication networks are the ones that “suggest” more content from you whenever you’re on a publisher site like CNN, Time Magazine, or National Geographic. The most well-known content discovery networks are <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/">Outbrain</a> and <a href="http://taboola.com/">Taboola</a>—both of them offer analytics, allow geographical targeting, and strive to drive organic traffic.</p>
<p>The choice of what to use is yours, but here are a few general tips:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Make your page easy to share. The whole point of having your content &#8220;discovered&#8221; is the organic traffic that comes with it—along with the organic shares. Are your share buttons always visible and accessible to the user?</li>
<li>Try to get more out of every person who visits your site. Ask for, at best, an email (maybe in exchange for premium content like an ebook) or, at worst, a Facebook like or Twitter follow.</li>
<li>Build your retargeting audience. Use Google Analytics to build an audience based on the landing page for your Outbrain or Taboola campaign. This way, anyone who&#8217;s visited your site as a result of content discovery will see your ads as they continue to search the web, keeping you in their mind for the extent of their web-surfing duration.</li>
<li>Test-launch your content. You can use discovery networks to test different headlines against each other, like a soft launch or A/B testing. If you do this before a print run or making something premium content, it can save you a lot of time and money.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>Reuse what you have</h4>
<p>Why do more work than you have to? Republish &amp; repurpose your old content that works. Make an infographic, podcast, slideshare, or—even better—a quiz! Here’s a full list of things you can turn one high-performing post into:</p>
<p>Infographic<br />
Slideshare presentation<br />
<a href="http://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">Quiz</a><br />
<a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Poll</a><br />
Guest post<br />
Webinar<br />
Ebook<br />
PDF<br />
Podcast<br />
Video<br />
Email course<br />
List</p>
<p>You can also straight republish your content on sites like Quora, LinkedIn, and Medium. Just remember to link back to your original content and make allowances to how it will affect analytics.</p>
<p>Well, that’s that! Let us know your successes or failures with any of these platforms in the comments—or if we&#8217;ve left anything major out of our content promotion strategy guide, let us know. And if you want to hear about a quiz-specific success story, learn how <a href="http://www.internetmarketinginc.com/blog/case-study-million-dollar-quiz/" target="_blank">IMI made a quiz for Zenni Optical that generated a million dollars</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lovethatshot.co.uk/icon-prom-from-love-that-shot-photography/"><img class="  alignright wp-image-1668" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/prom-couple.jpg" alt="prom-couple" width="360" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>A 5% lead conversion rate is a lot like asking your cousin to prom. Sure—it&#8217;s better than nothing, but you and I both know it could be a whole lot better.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s webinar, we sat down with Sushant Sharma of <a href="https://vwo.com/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a> to discuss how quizzes are driving killer conversion rates. To say it was a helpful conversation would be grossly inadequate. Read on to get a few insights into the process behind 20-30% conversion rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/marketing-quiz" target="_blank">As I recently discussed on the Wordstream blog</a>, we recently discovered that Qzzr quizzes ending with lead capture forms were successful at acquiring a lead 10% of the time. Yeah, that&#8217;s the average! It only took basic marketing prowess to get above average conversion rates.</p>
<p>What would you do if your conversion rates were that high?</p>
<p>Owen and Sushant shared countless quiz tips (and you really should watch the webinar below to get all of them), but we&#8217;ll highlight just three that will get you started:</p>
<h4>Know your audience</h4>
<p>Quizzes and polls are examples of interactive content, but without knowing who you&#8217;re designing the quiz for, there&#8217;s not going to be much interaction. Here&#8217;s a quick diagram that illustrates precisely the mindset you should be in when designing your quiz.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1669" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-29-at-12.03.14-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-29 at 12.03.14 AM" width="1074" height="603" /></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t do you a bit of good to create a quiz that only you would want to take. This seems obvious, but it&#8217;s remarkably common. Learn as much as you can about your target personas.</p>
<p>What challenges do they face? What entertains them? What do they want to learn more about? Maybe draw inspiration from the news or pop culture, depending on your audience. Find that happy middle where interaction flows naturally. Turn that prom date from awkward cousin conversation into riveting, engaging dialogue. That&#8217;s what spurs an above average conversion rate.</p>
<h4>Show me something cool</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png"><img class="  wp-image-1671 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png" alt="dogbounty" width="378" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Quizzes are by nature much more social than other forms of content. They&#8217;re personal. So ditch the office-speak and loosen the tie and have a little fun with it.</p>
<p>Remember this quiz from the webinar? Again, pardon the crass title, but it&#8217;s not what you think. This is from the College Humor quiz <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6971979/quiz-whose-boobs-are-these">&#8220;Whose cleavage is this?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t recognize him, this is Dog the Bounty Hunter. While I&#8217;m not sure if I would classify his cleavage as &#8220;cool,&#8221; you get the point. This quiz is engaging because it&#8217;s out of the ordinary and combats the overarching assumption.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another one, since we&#8217;re on the bounty hunter theme (no, I&#8217;m not going to make any references to the <del>hit</del> <a href="https://youtu.be/e4N220XLowE" target="_blank">90s bounty hunter-themed TV show Renegade</a>). When Sideshow Collectibles made this quiz: <a href="https://www.sideshowtoy.com/blog/quiz-which-star-wars-bounty-hunter-are-you" target="_blank">&#8220;Which Star Wars bounty hunter are you?&#8221;</a>, they could&#8217;ve asked simple, straightforward questions. But they saw the magic of a quiz, and created questions like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png"><img class="  wp-image-1672 alignleft" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png" alt="scum" width="459" height="275" /></a></p>
<p>A quiz is not a real assessment. You aren&#8217;t confined by the bounds of scientific thought and limits, so again—have some fun with it.</p>
<h4>Help me feel sufficiently assessed</h4>
<p>I know I just said quizzes aren&#8217;t real assessments, but I wasn&#8217;t completely serious. They need to retain some degree of legitimacy for people to invest in the result. If your quiz is three questions long, but then you try and offer me insights about who I am, it&#8217;s not going to seem legitimate to me and I&#8217;ll be significantly less likely to share my results.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1673" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png" alt="how many questions" width="1024" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>The quiz on the left isn&#8217;t likely to make me feel confident in the result I get. &#8220;Oh, I should buy a Lexus? You asked me three questions, I don&#8217;t think you know me well enough to make that kind of call.&#8221; However, in the quiz on the right, there are 10 questions to ascertain my personality, preferences, and character. So the fact that I get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_302_Mustang" target="_blank">Boss 302</a> makes me want to brag about it to my friends.</p>

<p>One of the three most important tricks to making a quiz is great imagery (<a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/3-tips-will-help-make-engaging-quizzes/" target="_blank">the other two being an engaging topic and eye-catching title</a>). Easy enough, right? If only that were true—landing the right pictures can be a real chore. Unfortunately, it isn’t really feasible to have an on-staff photographer for all your quizzes (as nice as that would be), but looking for images on the web means worrying about licenses and usage rights. Well let us take care of that for you! <strong>We put together an easy resource to help you easily find the best copyright-free images on the web.</strong></p>
<h4>Want a personalized recommendation? Scroll to the bottom to take our quiz!</h4>
<p>We all know about Google Images filter by usage rights, Flickr, and Getty Images. But our favorite websites are the ones with fantastic photographers, pages and pages of photos, and—of course—easy-to-use search (because no one wants to scroll past pages of landscape when what you really need is a picture of a car). There are so many great new sites with an emphasis on completely free, breathtaking photos that we just had to share them with you. <strong>(Note: Not all images are copyright-free. Some of them may require attribution, so be sure to check out the license for each site you use.)</strong></p>
<p>Have a favorite that’s not on our list? Link it in the comments and share the love.</p>
<h2>The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images</h2>
<h3>10. <a href="http://www.imcreator.com/free" target="_blank">IM Free</a></h3>
<p>Made by IMCreator, IM Free has a well-categorized inventory of thousands of stock photos. It’s loaded in the Cityscape, People, and Nature categories, but falls a little short if you need pictures for something about tech or business. Just remember that any image off this site needs attribution to the creator.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1610 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>(Photos by Jonathan Kos-Read, Instant Vantage, and 55Laney69)</p>
<h3>9. <a href="http://negativespace.co/" target="_blank">Negative Space</a></h3>
<p>The selection is limited, but the best part of Negative Space is that you can sort by color or even copy space position (for your non-quiz stock photo needs). And if you want to try your hand at design or editing, you can download the raw file too.</p>

<p>A small collection (couple hundred) of photos to be used more for inspiration than anything. What’s special about this site is the ability to filter by dominant color.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1612 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>7. <a href="https://stocksnap.io/" target="_blank">StockSnap</a></h3>
<p>The selection on StockSnap might be a bit limited, but that’s because the two-person team curates and hand-selects each photo for a “bad ass repository of beautiful stock photography.” The layout isn’t bad either, showing you the number of views and downloads for each photo and also letting you see what’s trending on the site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1613 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>6. <a href="http://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a></h3>
<p>Pexels has over 2000 photos chosen from other stock photo sites across the internet. It’s an easy-on-the eyes site with a great selection. One downside is there’s no categorization, so trying to browse photos may get a little messy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1614 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://stockphotos.io/" target="_blank">StockPhotos.io</a></h3>
<p>If you’re a Pinterest lover, you’re in luck: StockPhoto.io’s website is almost the same. StockPhotos.io has 30,000+ photos (all searchable!), well tagged and well categorized. There’s also an illustrations board, if that’s more up your alley.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1615 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>4. <a href="http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/stock-up" target="_blank">Stock Up</a></h3>
<p>This one might be cheating a little: Stock Up consolidates 21 different copyright-free image sites, including great sites like Life of Pix and New Old Stock Photos, into one. Clean layout and easy search are a plus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1616 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>3. <a href="http://picjumbo.com/" target="_blank">PicJumbo</a></h3>
<p>It may not be the prettiest site you’ve ever seen (and definitely not the most ad-free), but the categories and tags—not to mention the sheer volume of photos—definitely make PicJumbo worth it. Also a bonus is the fact that you can see other tags on photos you’re looking at. If you’re so inclined, going premium means you can download bundles of photos.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1617 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>2. <a href="http://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a></h3>
<p>Not only does Pixabay have 380,000+ photos, it also has vectors and drawings. The categorization and search is impeccable—and you can see a photographer’s entire collection. The size selection at download is pretty nifty too. Oh, and did we mention each photo’s hand-picked for quality?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/9.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1618 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/9.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>1. <a href="http://finda.photo/" target="_blank">FindA.Photo</a></h3>
<p>Like Stock Up, FindA.Photo is also a collection site &#8211; it takes its thousands of photos from Unsplash, MMT, and Picography among others—but with a kick: browsing by HTML color code. Just type “&#8211;color #000000” (replace #000000 with the HTML code of the color you’re looking for) into the search bar. You can also <a href="http://finda.photo/search/tips#tags">search with width or height</a>, aspect ratio, or the average saturation of the image (great for finding black-and-whites.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1619 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>There you go—ten of the best copyright-free image websites on the web! But maybe ten&#8217;s too many and you can&#8217;t narrow it down. Don&#8217;t worry, Qzzr&#8217;s got you covered. Take our quiz and we&#8217;ll <em>tell</em> you which website is best for you.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="65564"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>Can’t get enough copyright-free images? Here are some sites we’ve found that’ll send you a few new ones by newsletter every week or so.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://unsplash.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=655606e77350bfa30e1ab5457&amp;id=9493051dec" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>: 10 absolutely stunning, minimalistic pictures every 10 days. Also has <a href="https://unsplash.com/">a great site</a> (albeit a somewhat limited search functionality) that FindA.Photo and others pull from.</li>
<li><a href="http://littlevisuals.co/" target="_blank">Little Visuals</a>: 7 photos every week.</li>
<li><a href="http://join.deathtothestockphoto.com/" target="_blank">Death to the Stock Photo</a>: This “coffee for the modern creative” sends photos every month.</li>
<li><a href="http://jaymantri.com/" target="_blank">Jay Mantri</a>: A designer in Santa Monica, CA who releases 7 pictures every Thursday.</li>
<li><a href="http://snapwi.us7.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b365306a53a9c7e150ae6c5e1&amp;id=492b46284e" target="_blank">Snapwire Snaps</a>: 7 hand-picked images in your inbox every 7 days.</li>
<li><a href="http://realisticshots.com/" target="_blank">Realistic Shots</a>: Another 7 photos every week for your inbox pleasure.</li>
<li><a href="http://newsletter.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a>: We mentioned Pexels above in #6, but we wanted to add their monthly newsletter to the mix too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want to pay for your stock photos, there’s a market for that too. Some of our favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stocksy.com/" target="_blank">Stocksy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://creativemarket.com/photos" target="_blank">Creative Market</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a> and Qzzr got together to talk about quizzes, content marketing, and going viral—and how to use tools from them to do all three. Our one-hour webinar (embedded below) gave a lot of great tips and hints, but the crème de la crème had to be the six steps to creating a sweet quiz from our Chief Qwizard Owen and BuzzSumo’s Stephen Walsh.</p>
<h5><a href="http://ctt.ec/2NAdM" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Click to Tweet your thanks to Stephen!</a></h5>
<p>So we thought, why not turn those steps into a step-by-step list in a blog post so you can refer to it again and again when you make a quiz? Let us give you the meat and potatoes—and if we leave you wanting more, our webinar’s always there for a listen.</p>
<p><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1599" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Why-quizzes--300x150.png" alt="Why quizzes- 6 steps to a sweet quiz" width="484" height="242" /></p>
<p>First questions first: why are quizzes the new golden child of content marketing? Sure, they’re a form of media. But why are they more popular than, say, infographics or surveys or a plain old blog post? It’s because quizzes are engaging and nourishing. We can interact with them and—lo and behold!—they interact back. They feed us by telling us things about ourselves. As humans, we are our own favorite subjects.</p>
<p>So to all the brands, marketers, and publishers out there: make us feel good about ourselves, make us laugh, and give us something to brag about. And when you do, we’ll interact like crazy—to the tune of 82% conversion rates.</p>
<h3><strong>The 6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Do your research</h4>
<p>The best quizzes come from content that gets shares—content that resonates with its readers, spawns controversy and questions, or is easily misunderstood. So making a great quiz comes from understanding the content. Look at your old content with a fresh eye. Lists, infographics, posts with lots of comments—why can’t they be turned into quizzes?</p>
<p>This is also where BuzzSumo comes in. <a href="http://buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">Using their tool</a>, you can search topics and websites (even adding “quiz” or “?” after the terms to limit your results to quizzes) and see what’s being shared across the internet. Stephen made a great point during the webinar that recycling content for quizzes from checklists or how-to’s is incredibly easy. Get an idea of what’s out there—and how you make it even better.</p>
<h4>2. Choose your quiz</h4>
<p>There are two types of quizzes: graded and outcome. Your graded quizzes have titles like “How well do you know ___“ or “Are you a ___ expert?” and outcome quizzes are more along the lines of “Which superhero are you?” and “What color is your personality?”</p>
<p>Graded quizzes are about making people feel good about their score and educating as you go along. Assign outcomes like “You got 90%! You’re a genius!!” rather than simply “You got 90%”, and use the feedback option in Qzzr when you’re creating a quiz to throw in more interesting facts.</p>
<p>Outcome quizzes, on the other hand, need shareworthy resolutions. They should be designed with results that make people feel good and look good by helping people define themselves, invoking awe or laughter, or helping people share how they want to look to their friends.</p>
<p>Something surprisingly often overlooked in quiz creation is the importance of the title. It’s the first thing your potential quiz taker will see—so make it good. Good content always needs to have a hook, and that hook for a quiz is the title. BuzzSumo can help by showing you the most popular quizzes (hint: a lot of them have “hardest” or “ultimate” in the title).</p>
<p>We’re big on interactive content here at Qzzr, so we want to ask you: do graded quizzes or outcome quizzes sound more appealing to you? Take the poll (made with our sister tool <a href="http://www.pollcaster.com">Pollcaster</a>) and see what other people chose.</p>
<p><iframe id="mv-widget-KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" src="https://api.movementventures.com/widget/poll/KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" width="500px" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h4>3. Strategize your call to action</h4>
<p>People use quizzes in content marketing for lots of reasons. So what’s yours? Are you trying to generate leads? Make a sale? Gain more newsletter subscribers? Get more traffic? Defining your reason for wanting a quiz determines the call-to-action, which in turn helps you design your quiz.</p>
<p>First, understand the persona of your audience. Use BuzzSumo to look into the space you’re targeting and find topic ideas. Always focus on what your audience cares about or what both you and your audience care about jointly—otherwise you lose them.</p>
<p>Next, define the outcomes of your quiz. Make it something that people are proud to share. And make sure your call to action, whether that’s putting in an email address or linking to another blog post, is related to that outcome.</p>
<h4>4. Make your quiz</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have a secret recipe for the perfect quiz (don’t worry—we’re working on it). But in the meantime, here are some guidelines for you to follow in your search for virality:</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something cool.</h5>
<p>Keep me engaged by asking me interesting questions (quality over quantity)</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something meaningful. And convince me it’s meaningful.</h5>
<p>Make me feel sufficiently assessed. I won’t believe that you really know who I am or who I should be if you’ve only asked me three questions.</p>
<h5>&gt; Feed me and give me something to brag about.</h5>
<p>Give me feedback. Tell me if I’m right or wrong and then give me something else interesting. And in the outcome, tell me more about myself.</p>
<h5>&gt; Make me laugh.</h5>
<p>This quiz is a perfect example of making people laugh. We usually suggest people make positive outcomes—this quiz went the opposite direction and made the outcomes hilariously offensive. It worked—it&#8217;s been taken over 200,000 times and people love sharing their [sometimes painful] results.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="22314"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h5>&gt; Make me an offer I can’t refuse.</h5>
<p>This ties back into the call-to-action. Basically, tell me who I am and then tell me why I want what you have to offer me, whether that’s another blog post to read, an offer or newsletter to sign up for, or a drawing to enter into.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1600" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Make-it...-300x150.png" alt="How do you make a sweet quiz? Use these tips" width="594" height="297" /></p>
<p>Make sure to use images. We’re visual beings and we want to be shown things. Equally important, images need to be licensed to be legal for commercial use. So if you’re a bit short on pictures, you can do a Google Image search and filter using Advanced Search to only find those labeled for reuse. For more info, see our post on <a title="Qzzr Answers: Images and Qzzr" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/images-qzzr/">Images and Qzzr</a>.</p>
<h5>5. Share your quiz</h5>
<p>Now that your quiz has been made, share it with the world! Put it on your blog and social media. BuzzSumo can also help you step up your game here too. Search your topic (or even rival quizzes on your topic) and click “View Sharers” for a certain piece of content. Find the influencers with high domain authority and retweet ratios who shared those pieces and ask if they’d be interested in sharing yours too.</p>
<h5>6. Learn, adapt, and improve it</h5>
<p>The best part of using Qzzr to make a quiz is the analytics that come with it. Test different quiz titles, questions, and outcomes to see what appeals to your target customer.</p>
<p>There you go—that’s the distillation of our webinar in partnership with BuzzSumo. Good luck going viral and merry quiz-making! We’ll leave you with a few last surprising facts we learned from Stephen and Owen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher sharing something is what it takes to make it viral.</li>
<li>The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
<li>The #1 NYTimes article in 2013 was a quiz. And in case that’s not recent enough for you, nine out of ten of the most shared stories on Facebook in January 2015 were quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more great tidbits you probably didn’t know (and to hear some of Owen’s terrible puns), listen to our webinar with BuzzSumo in its entirety.</p>

<p>We had an awesome webinar last week with Nicole Kroese from Likeable Local. Jokes were made, fun times were had, and a whole heap of helpful information was imparted. We learned that Owen would look great in a double-strap tankini and that Nicole is a dancer – but most of all, <strong>we learned how to make a quiz and intelligently promote it to double your social engagement and conversion</strong>.

<h3>Why make a quiz to promote your brand?</h3>
<p>Quizzes are at the forefront of a content renaissance. The internet is flooded with content, and most of it not very good. Your goal as a top shot marketer is to help yours cut through the fog and stand out.</p>
<p>Surveys, infographics, and lists are great and all, but quizzes hold more potential than many of today’s other popular content types. Luckily for you, we’re going to show you precisely why.</p>
<p>Aren’t quizzes just the same as surveys?</p>
<p>No – here’s why:</p>
<h4>Surveys come wrapped in desperation</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Please-Sir-Survey-small.jpeg" alt="survey vs quiz" width="550" height="733" /></p>
<p>While very similar in nature, quizzes capture people’s attention and draw them in – they can’t get enough! The proof is in the pudding: the New York Times’ most shared article in 2013 was a quiz, and nine of the ten most shared posts on Facebook in January 2015 were as well.</p>
<h4>So why are quizzes so irresistible?</h4>
<p>We think it’s because they’re so engaging and nourishing. We can’t wait to get a result and find out something interesting about ourselves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1578" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stop-telling-me-quote.jpg" alt="Stop telling me quote" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>Quizzes have an 81% completion rate – people stick with them. <strong>The questions <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/79684693-is-your-content-an-enthralling-conversation-or-an-awkward-goodbye" target="_blank">act like an interesting conversation</a>, which drives them to share little bits of themselves in order to learn more</strong>. What’s more is that 82% of people will take a quiz if they see it in their social feed. So you post a quiz – on average, 82% of the people that see it will start it, and 81% of those people will finish it.</p>
<p>Is that not impressive enough for you? The average quiz takes roughly two and a half minutes to complete (which does wonders for your SEO), and is shared over 1,900 times (which is pretty good, if we say so ourselves).</p>
<p><strong>All of this combines to make quizzes faster, cheaper, and more effective than almost any other type of content.</strong></p>
<p>Social media and content mavens have two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive traffic</li>
<li>Drive conversions</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of quizzes that have done that:</p>
<p>News site <a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=29674897" target="_blank">KSL.com created a quiz</a> to test people’s knowledge of the US Citizenship Test. It’s been been taken over 137,000 times (!) and the comment board got lit up.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="5235"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script>CarThrottle is an online automotive enthusiasts’ community. They posted a quiz, <a href="http://www.carthrottle.com/post/how-much-of-a-petrolhead-are-you-really-70-per-cent-means-youre-doing-well/" target="_blank">Are You a True Gearhead?</a>, and it’s been taken over 300,000 times – at the time of this writing, it had 473 comments. If that’s not traffic, I don’t know what is.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="676"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>Online optics company Zenni Optical <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank">launched a quiz to help people find the eyeglass style</a> that best represented them. Questions drew out information on color, lifestyle, and face shape to provide an accurate recommendation. It has worked – <strong>to the tune of <a title="The Anatomy of the Million Dollar Quiz [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/million-dollar-quiz-revenue/" target="_blank">nearly $1 million in revenue</a>, and climbing</strong>.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="7951"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script>So, how do I make a quiz?</p>
<h3>Research topics</h3>
<p>You can make a quiz, or you can make a great quiz. Studying great content can give you insights into what will perform well for you. Ask these questions to set yourself up for success from the get-go: What’s trending right now? What topics have been successful for you in the past? Have any of your competitors made quizzes before? Which topics have been most successful? Are there decisions that people struggle to make? We don’t get any kickbacks from <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">Buzzsumo</a> for saying this, but we’ve found their tool extremely helpful for research on buzzworthy topics. Try it out and see if it’s any good for you.</p>
<h3>Choose quiz title and type</h3>
<p>Your title is your quiz’s headline, so the same thought should go into it. You want to engage people – make them want to drill in and get a result. There are two quiz types: graded and outcome. Graded quizzes follow the traditional quiz archetype – they have right or wrong answers. The end result of a graded quiz is a percentage (You got ___% of the questions correct). An outcome quiz does not have right or wrong answers; it’s questions gather information to lead to – you guessed it – an outcome (You got “AC Slater” in the “Which Saved By The Bell character are you?” quiz). Here are a few quiz title examples given for each quiz type: <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Quiz-types.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Quiz-types.png" alt="Quiz types" width="560" height="315" /></a> If you’d like more information on what each quiz type offers, <a title="Graded or Outcome? Tap Into the Psychology of Quiz Types" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/graded-or-outcome-psychology-of-quiz-types/" target="_blank">we’ve written before with a bit more detail</a>.</p>
<h3>Do your research and gather media</h3>
<p>This is where you’ll strategize your quiz content. If you’re creating a graded quiz, you’ll need a lot of facts. If it’s an outcome quiz, be strategic and fun about how you ask for information. Example: In your “Which farm animal are you?” quiz, don’t ask “Which food sounds good?” and then show pictures of hay, corn, oats, etc. Come up with another way of getting responses that aren’t so obvious and boring. Images must be used in accordance with all copyrights and restrictions. Here’s a resource on <a title="Qzzr Answers: Images and Qzzr" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/images-qzzr/" target="_blank">finding images for quizzes</a>, and DesignRope has a great blog post with <a href="http://designrope.com/design/find-stock-photos-dont-suck/" target="_blank">14 places to find stock photos that don’t suck</a>.</p>
<h3>Create and embed</h3>
<p>If you have all of your stuff together, this is the easy part. <a href="http://www.qzzr.com" target="_blank">Use a platform like Qzzr</a> to make life easy on yourself, and you’ll be impressed with the imagery as well.</p>
<h3>Share and promote</h3>
<p>This was where Nicole and Likeable Local’s expertise really shines. Content used to promote itself – you could create a website and throw some words and pictures on it, and people would come to it. Not anymore. For one thing, the internet is now inundated with clutter. “Content” is everywhere, and it can be hard to cut through the fog to be seen by your prospects. In addition, things like “<a href="http://www.inc.com/dave-kerpen/facebook-reachageddon-is-coming-3-key-solutions-for-your-business.html" target="_blank">Facebook Reachageddon</a>” made us pay to play. It’s now necessary to open up the wallet to make sure your posts get seen. It’s not all doom n’ gloom, though. If you create high quality and relevant quizzes, and promote them well, they WILL pay off. Here’s where more research pays off: (Are you detecting a theme?) <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1585" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Where-are-prospects-hanging-out.png" alt="Where are prospects hanging out?" width="1277" height="426" /> Social media has a 100% higher lead-to-close rate than outbound marketing, so spend the bulk of your time there. Use these two ways to get your content in front of the right prospects:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Run awesome paid social ads</li>
<li>Create and expand your fan club</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h4> Run awesome paid ads</h4>
<p>Unless you want to waste your money, follow these bits of advice when creating ads:</p>
<p><strong>Set goals</strong> – But not the generic ones like “I’d like to be successful with this campaign.” Nah, you gotta set SMART goals. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SET-SMART-GOALS.png" alt="set smart goals" width="1024" height="512" /> Some of this is already built into the social ads platform. Do you want your ad to:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>send people to your website?</li>
<li>increase conversions on your website?</li>
<li>boost your posts?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1582" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ad-campaign-goals.png" alt="social media ad campaign goals" width="1330" height="675" /> <strong>Reach the right people</strong> – Here’s Likeable Local’s founder, Dave Kerpen, on reaching the right people:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
You know what&#8217;s cooler than reaching 1 billion people on Facebook? Reaching the perfect 1000. Or 100. or 10. — Dave Kerpen (@DaveKerpen) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveKerpen/status/313643603748614144">March 18, 2013</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>One way to do this is by creating smart audiences. Facebook allows you to build wide profiles of potential customers by adding particular demographic, interest, job title, or location filters. The robustness by which you can find the right people is really cool, actually.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/audiences.png" alt="audiences" width="643" height="466" /></p>
<p><strong>Scale smarter</strong> – Don’t run before you can walk. There’s no need to. Follow these three pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double down on what’s working</li>
<li>You may be sick of your ad, but your prospects aren’t</li>
<li>Adapt to current trends</li>
</ul>
<h4>Create and expand your fan club</h4>
<p>If what you’re bringing to the table is truly meaningful and you can get it in front of people effectively, you WILL attract potential customers. Make sure that when they come to you, you’re prepared to turn them into raving fans. Here’s how you can do that:</p>
<p><strong>Choose a strategic partner</strong> – A good partner means doubled promotion and visibility. Even more so if you find someone with a larger reach than you. Look for thought leaders in your industry, and complementary companies (those that don’t directly compete with you for customers, but that contribute different value).</p>
<p><strong>Make sharing easy and fun</strong> – All content should have a call to action, preferably to share. Cool new tools like Click to Tweets make it easy for readers to share a pre-designed tweet.</p>
<p><strong>Listen and respond</strong> – Track keywords, hashtags and mentions that affect your industry or brand, and respond to everyone, because…</p>
<p><strong>Social media is the new word of mouth</strong> – 90% of people trust business recommendations from someone they know, and people are 4X more likely to buy when referred by a friend. If this is true, then you know the inverse is true as well – so make sure you promptly address negative comments as well.</p>
<p>Social ads, shared posts, and popular content have built in endorsements from friends – potential customers will see reference to friends who have liked your page or content you’ve shared.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Quizzes hold immense power to engage and convert your potential customers, but like any other content, they’re only effective if people see them. Luckily, there are experts like Owen and Nicole, who love sharing the tips and tricks that have made them and their companies successful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1574 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CONTENT-EXPERIENCE-1-e1431422474450.png" alt="Create an awesome content experience" width="1016" height="512" /></p>
<p>You know your audience. You’ve done your research. Your copy is on-brand and edited to perfection. Your distribution strategy is proven to spread your content far and wide across millions of screens.</p>
<p>In short, you’ve created a shiny new piece of interactive content that you know your audience will love.</p>
<p>But what happens when it doesn’t perform as expected?</p>
<p>Before you waste your time nitpicking at all the little things that might be wrong with your individual piece of content – font size, headlines, and so on – I’m going to tell you to stop.</p>
<h5>You see, the problem might not be with your content. <strong>The problem might be with your content experience.</strong></h5>
<p>So, how do you create a content experience that’s sure to help your content generate leads?</p>
<h3>Crafting Your Content</h3>
<p>Your content must be valuable, relevant and consistent. Equally as important, however, is that it must also <strong>tie back to your content marketing goals.</strong></p>
<p>Every single piece of content you create should be accompanied by a clear plan outlining how it will help you get more views, downloads, subscribers, or whatever you’re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>For example, running a quiz “just for fun” is only a good idea of you want your audience to just have fun before they bounce. If your ultimate goal is to incorporate the quiz as part of a larger campaign — e.g., to encourage webinar registrations or eBook downloads — it’s not enough to just put up a quiz and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Ensure the quiz is engaging enough to complete to the end, and provide guidance as to what the reader should do next (more on that below). Have one goal in mind for the next step — don’t ask multiple things of your audience.</p>
<p>Once you’ve hooked your audience by having them complete the quiz, don’t just let them go! Supporting your awesome content with a killer content experience will help compel them to stay and eventually convert.</p>
<h3>Building The Content (User) Experience</h3>
<p>As intelligent and savvy as your audience members are, they don’t always know what they want. As a marketer, it’s YOUR job to make it easy for them to find out.</p>
<p>And do exactly that: <strong>Make it easy</strong>.</p>
<p>Think about IKEA’s shopping experience. You don’t just drop into IKEA and have to fight your way through a pile of furniture to find your Ektorp sofa— <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/16018427-more-than-meatballs-what-ikea-can-teach-us-about-content-marketing" target="_blank">IKEA provides a clear engagement path</a> that makes your shopping experience all the more delightful. You go exactly where they want you to and ultimately end up at the checkout.</p>
<p>Provide a similar engagement path in your content marketing. Do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Including targeted &amp; contextual CTAs</strong>: Let’s say you write a blog post called “10 Advanced Marketing Tips”, but you include a CTA at the bottom of the post that reads, “Free eBook: Content Marketing for Beginners”. This doesn’t make any sense! Your CTAs should be as targeted and contextual to your content as possible to create a smooth content experience.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporating responsive design</strong>: One size doesn’t fit all. Make sure your audience is able to consume your content in the best format, regardless of device, time of day, or any other external factors.</li>
<li><strong>Organizing your content strategically</strong>: Don’t invite your guests to a messy home. Organize your content in a way that makes sense for your audience (e.g. by format, buyer persona, etc.) to help increase discoverability.</li>
<li><strong>Featuring recommended content</strong>: Use a content recommendation tool like BrightInfo to feature other awesome pieces of your content that are related to the subject matter of the content currently being consumed. If someone is reading up on tips to generate quizzes, chances are they’ll be more inclined to read more about it.</li>
<li><strong>Including appropriate visuals</strong>: There is so much data surrounding the effectiveness of visual content that it astounds me when marketers either don’t use images or don’t use images effectively. Take the time to find, produce and optimize images that enhance your content experience.</li>
<li><strong>Including social share buttons and a search bar</strong>: These features sound simple, but they’ll not only make your content easy to find and share, but will also help you gauge which kind of content your audience is more willing to consume.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gating Content for Lead Gen</h3>
<p>Once you’ve built your content experience with the considerations above, it’s time to start generating leads. The best and fastest way to generate leads from your content? <strong>Gate your premium content</strong> to capture your visitor’s information.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing a “gatekeeper” for your content, there are a couple of options available.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Landing Pages</strong>: Landing pages are great because they allow you to generate a compelling headline, more visuals, and can be optimized to improve performance. However, using a landing page usually involves removing your user from your content, which could create a leaky content experience.</li>
<li><strong>Pop-up or “overlay” CTAs</strong>: Overlay CTAs provide a much more integrated approach to lead generation as they can be placed just on top of a piece of content, creating that feeling of having something “just out of reach”. Using these types of CTAs also shortens the conversion path by skipping the step of waiting for the piece of content to arrive in your inbox — once the form is completed, it’s right there and ready for consumption.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could go on about best practices for gating premium content, but at the end of the day, your method of capturing leads must be integrated into your content experience.</p>
<h3>Put Your Awesome Content in an Awesome Experience</h3>
<p>Don’t let your amazing content go to waste, and don’t underestimate the power of an amazing content experience.</p>
<p>Put your content in an experience that is designed to achieve your goals and easy for your users to follow. Then, give yourself a high-five as the leads start pouring in!</p>
