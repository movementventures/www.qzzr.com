<p>Are you bonkers for fun quizzes? You’re not alone—millions of people take these things every day. If you were to scroll down your Facebook feed right now, you&#8217;d probably be more likely to come across one than a food pic from even your most insufferable friend (you know which one I&#8217;m talking about).</p>
<p>Though not exclusively for fun, quizzes do a great job of entertaining us. We’re immersed in the process, waiting with baited breath to find out how we did or what result we got. We just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have</span> to know more about ourselves, and a quiz is the easiest way to get there.</p>
<p>So allow us to enlighten you with these 10 quizzes. There’s bound to be something in here for you, but if not, leave a comment with what you’re into, and I bet we can find one for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Quizzes are the new list articles, according to Harvard University’s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/02/are-quizzes-the-new-lists-what-buzzfeeds-latest-viral-success-means-for-publishing/">Neiman Journalism Lab</a>.</p>
<p>While list articles have enjoyed popularity for sometime on big websites like Buzzfeed and The Daily Mail, their reign may be coming to an end with the dawn of the online quiz. From serious topics like “Which college should I attend?” to more lighthearted themes like “What breakfast cereal am I?”, people are flocking to online quizzes in droves every day across just about every social media platform.</p>
<p>A new tool is now available to help publishers and websites build unlimited quizzes for users to take and share across the Internet. It’s called Qzzr, a free quiz creation tool that can be used in pretty much any context.<span id="more-88"></span></p>
<p>“This tool can be used for teachers to create quick assignments for their classes,” Qzzr co-founder Josh Little said. “It can be used in training for new employees. It can be used by teens who want to find out what their friends know about them. There are virtually endless ways this tool can be used.”</p>
<p>“We’re seeing publishers use quizzes to get their content out there with more shares and user engagement,” Qzzr co-founder Josh Little said. “Marketers are using quizzes to segment users, drive them to offers based on responses, capture leads, and spread brand awareness. Of course, teachers can user Qzzr to quiz their students too. The possibilities are endless.”</p>
<p>“The best aspect of Qzzr is it’s free,” Little said</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1183 size-full" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Score-results-screenshot.png" alt="Score-results-screenshot" width="746" height="583" /></p>
<p>Qzzr allows users to build, embed and share their own quizzes online. Quizzes can be peppered with images, animated GIFs and other features to draw more eyes.</p>
<p>“Quizzes let people take some of the ‘me drug’.” Josh Little, Qzzr co-founder, said. “Buzzfeed and the NYTimes kicked off the quiz craze with two incredibly viral quizzes ‘What State Do You Actually Belong In?’ and ‘How Y’all, Youse and You Guys Talk’.”</p>
<p>While these quizzes were successful, Little said, the publishers had to put their own resources into building theses quizzes.</p>
<p>“The problem is those publishers have spent a ton of cash building their own tools,” He said. “Most people just can&#8217;t do that. With Qzzr, anyone can get the same amazing results for their own site, brand, or blog.”</p>
<p>Recently, Qzzr launched the capability to create outcome-based quizzes. This allow takers to plug in preferential information and determine which “whatever” they would be.</p>
<p>“We’ve joked that Qzzr is ‘the identity crisis generator’,” Dan Garfield, Qzzr’s lead marketer. “Users make quizzes that let their fans find out what 1980s cartoon character they are, what famous Civil War general they would have been, or what type of tree they might be.”</p>
<p>Qzzr allows users to create quizzes in an interactive format, Garfield said. Each question appears by itself and gives feedback after a response is made. This helps users remember, learn, and engage with the content.</p>
<p>While Qzzr is free to use, some features are reserved for pro publishers or marketers. For instance, free quizzes, embedded or not, drive shares back to Qzzr’s website but with Pro, quizzes can drive shares to the publisher’s embedded version of the quiz.</p>
<p>Unlike most embeddable quizzes out there, Garfield said, this makes it possible for the publisher to get full credit for the content they created.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know them, and although you say they are silly&#8230;.you secretly LOVE them, those insanely viral outcome quizzes that you see all over the internet and in your social channels from sites like the NYTimes, BuzzFeed, and Zimbio.  Did you know the #1 article on the NYTimes last year was a quiz?  And it launched on December 21st, so it only had 10 days to gain that status.<span id="more-87"></span></p>
<p>These fun quiz questions are blowing up right now, but it&#8217;s nothing new.  It&#8217;s a basic human need to seek to understand ourselves.  This need can be met for fun and trivial ways like <a href="http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/dysfunctional-tv-family-belong-0808813#!zxqjI">&#8220;What dysfunctional TV family should you belong to?&#8221;</a> or more serious selection tools like <a href="https://www.qzzr.co/quiz/if-you-were-a-coffee-what-kind-of-coffee-would-you-be">&#8220;If you were a coffee, what kind of coffee would you be?&#8221;</a>   As with anything on the web, it boils down to great content, but with content as a constant, the social lift on these outcome-based quizzes has been astronomical.  We&#8217;re seeing share rates hovering around the high sixty percent range on some of our most viral quizzes.  That&#8217;s just insane!  With Qzzr, you can create the same sort of viral results for your own site, brand, or blog.</p>
<p><strong>How to make a great outcome based quiz.</strong></p>
<p>Content is king and with quizzes that rule holds true.  What makes a great quiz experience?  Who do some quizzes go viral and others don&#8217;t?  What&#8217;s the difference between a quiz that has a 68% share rate and a 28% share rate?  Since quizzes are our business, we&#8217;ve done the research and found several of these aspects to be true on the most popular viral quizzes.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Tell me about me&#8221; &#8211; Great quizzes let users take the &#8220;me drug&#8221; for just a couple minutes.  They ask thought provoking, personal questions.  The better the questions, the more likely the user will be to buy-in to the outcome, which means they will be more likely to share the outcome too.</li>
<li>&#8220;Make me look good&#8221; &#8211; Viral quizzes have many potential outcomes, but all of them either make the user look good or funny.  No one will share a quiz outcome that they aren&#8217;t proud of.</li>
<li>Relevant topics (duh) &#8211; the topic, title, content, and outcome are super relevant to the channel they are found in.  The more niche the topic and channel, the more likely the outcome will be shares.</li>
<li>They are fun &#8211; Great quizzes use humor to keep users smiling all the way to the end.   They do this with either great writing or interesting images.</li>
<li>Visually stimulating &#8211; the most viral quizzes have great visuals.  Qzzr allows tons of latitude in the use of images from animated GIF&#8217;s to transparent PNG&#8217;s</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you create the content?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made many of our own quizzes and watched others.  While everyone has their own process, it usually follows some version of this flow.</p>
<p>(often the first few steps are done on a scratch pad or a doc outside of Qzzr, which makes for faster copy/paste work when building the quiz)</p>
<p><strong>1. Determine your topic and title for the audience you&#8217;ll be creating the quiz for.</strong>  We&#8217;ve seen that the title of the quiz plays a massive role in the conversion from visits to quiz starts.  Popular titles for outcome quizzes are &#8220;What _____ am I?&#8221; or &#8220;What kind of _____ are you?&#8221;  or &#8220;What ______ should you _____?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2. Create the possible outcomes.</strong>  You&#8217;ll want to create enough outcomes so that when this gets shared on social media channels, people see various results and wonder what they are.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Determine the qualities that would differentiate the outcomes from one another.</strong>  This can be done on a scratch pad while doing research.  Here are the notes from a &#8220;What tech entrepreneur are you&#8221; quiz we recently created.  Notice that this is not an exhaustive list of qualities, but you can start to see some themes that could be used to differentiate &#8211; Male or female?  School of choice?  Dropout or not?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-93 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-2.26.17-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 2.26.17 PM" width="584" height="449" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Craft the questions.  </strong>The questions really fall out of the research that you&#8217;ve done to differentiate the outcomes.  Not all aspects of differentiation or interesting or appropriate, but you definitely want your respondents to feel sufficiently assessed.   While asking which baby&#8217;s face is cuter is a fun question, it does beg the question &#8220;what does this have to do with what job I should have and will I really trust the results?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5.  Source or create the images.</strong>  Great quizzes are visually stunning.  Qzzr makes that easy, but it does take some time and creativity to end up with a great result.  Here is a quiz that shows you some of the possibilities of what you can do with images if you get creative.<br />
<script src="https://www.qzzr.co/qzzr_loader.js" async="" type="text/javascript" data-quiz="what-is-qzzr" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></script><br />
<strong>6. Build the quiz in Qzzr.</strong>  This is the easy part.  We&#8217;ve removed all friction from the process.  Once the content is created it should be very quick to copy and paste content and drag and drop images.</p>
<p><strong>Start with your outcomes</strong> &#8211; remember to write interesting, positive outcome descriptions that make any outcome feel great to the person receiving it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-10.48.12-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 10.48.12 AM" width="1378" height="1263" /></p>
<p><strong>Carve out questions</strong> &#8211; you can use images to create buttons</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-2.47.46-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 2.47.46 PM" width="1220" height="1120" /></p>
<p>Make sure you set up your redirect link so that social shares redirect back to your embed location.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="wp-image-115 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-12.09.14-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-26 at 12.09.14 PM" width="324" height="180" /></strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Publish and embed</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> for your audience to enjoy</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-97" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-2.48.36-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 2.48.36 PM" width="966" height="816" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we continue to build the killer quiz tool for marketers and publishers, we now allow the ability to drive respondents to an offer based on the outcome of the quiz.</p>
<p>Why is this awesome?  There are plenty of ways to put a button or offer in front of someone on the web, but how many are immersed in a focused learning experience about your product, service, or brand?  Education is sales and sales is education.  It is usually the best educating brand or product that wins.  With the right content, a quiz can be the magic trigger for a buying decision because of the power of questions.  Questions open the mind to an answer or an outcome.  Are you a candidate for Lasik surgery?  What jacket fits your personality?  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;d really like to find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>On average, respondents spend 2 minutes and 17 seconds on a Qzzr quiz.  What will you say to them?  What questions will you ask that will lead them to find themselves in your product?</p>
<p><span id="more-991"></span></p>
<p><strong>Make targeted offers</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little quiz that any online retailer could create in minutes.  Let&#8217;s pretend backcountry.com made this one.  At the end, the person taking the quiz knows exactly what backpack they need based upon their habits, and so they will be directed to a 20% offer if they buy now. Compare the likelihood of this targeted offer to any ad or linkbait found on the web. How likely are they to buy?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s super simple.  Just go to <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">qzzr.com</a> and create a quiz.  Click on settings (gear), and then select “Edit messaging &amp; form.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1174" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.03.42-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.03.42 PM" width="600" height="568" /></p>
<p>Select &#8220;Provide Offer&#8221;, and then enter your offer title, description, button label, and link (with any tracking codes you have):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1175" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.14.04-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.14.04 PM" width="600" height="516" /></p>
<p>This is what the offer looks like on the results page of the quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1176" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.16.01-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.16.01 PM" width="600" height="405" /></p>
<p><strong>Alternative method &#8211; outcome based offers</strong></p>
<p>If you want to make a different offer based upon the outcome of the quiz, it&#8217;s simple.  You can add a link to the results text.  To get more fancy, you can add an href tag like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1177" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.21.37-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.21.37 PM" width="600" height="348" /></p>
<p>This is what it looks like on the results page of the quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1179" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.26.03-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.26.03 PM" width="600" height="251" /></p>
<p>Anyone in the world can create a quiz for free with Qzzr.  To capture leads, present targeted offers, or generate Facebook likes, you&#8217;ll need to get a Pro or Enterprise package.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our next killer feature in building the ultimate content tool for marketers and publishers is the ability to get leads with a quiz.  Let us share just a few thoughts on why that is so exciting.  Most lead gen tools simply game the user into giving up their information.  They do this by dangling some sort of carrot like a gift or offer.</p>
<p>We have some questions about this approach &#8211; What kind of people enter their information?  Are they sincerely interested in your product or brand?  What quality are those leads?<span id="more-990"></span></p>
<p>With Qzzr, there are two main advantages over the other lead gen tools out there:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can help customers self-qualify for your product, service or brand by the questions you ask and by the feedback you give.  People spend an average of 2 minutes and 17 seconds taking a Qzzr quiz, so you have a few minutes of their undivided attention on the web. By the end of the quiz, you will have a good idea of who is most likely to convert into a paying customer. How important would that be to lead quality?</li>
<li>With Qzzr, you don&#8217;t just get a faceless email &#8211; you have extremely rich data to support exactly who this person is and how they think and feel.  How valuable would this be to your sales team?</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s a super-simple quiz that any car dealership could make in minutes.  In this example, we will offer the potential customer a $1,000 bonus on their trade in exchange for their email.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make a quiz like this</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just go to <a title="Qzzr" href="https://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">qzzr.com</a> and make a quiz for your blog, website, product, or brand. Before you publish the quiz, click on settings, and then select &#8220;Edit messaging and form&#8221; underneath &#8220;Leads &amp; Offers.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1169" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.33.43-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.33.43 PM" width="600" height="299" /> <a href="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.22.20-PM.png"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, select whether you want to capture emails, provide an offer, or get Facebook likes. In this example, we will select &#8220;Capture emails&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1169" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.33.43-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.33.43 PM" width="600" height="299" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, give people a reason to give you their email address. Write a compelling description that communicates the value you will offer them if they give you their information.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1171" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.36.18-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.36.18 PM" width="590" height="474" /></p>
<p>The form will show up above the result, allowing the quiz taker to consider your offer on the way to seeing their results. When someone finished taking your quiz, this is what they will see just before they get to their result:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1172" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.38.17-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.38.17 PM" width="600" height="410" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The team has been hard at work to bring new features to Qzzr. All of these features are available, starting today, for all users. Tell us what you think below.<span id="more-61"></span></p>
<h2>Images and animated GIFs</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-06-at-4.47.57-PM-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-06-at-4.47.57-PM-1.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-06 at 4.47.57 PM-1" width="750" height="605" /></a><br />
Animated gifs are one of our favorite modes of communication in the office. Who doesn’t love a good gif? Beyond gifs you can now ask and answer questions using images. This opens up all kinds of great questions: “who/where/what is this?”, “pick your favorite…”, or ”which one of these babies is the cutest?”</p>
<p>(This guy for sure)</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/baby-amazed-scared-laughing-1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-66 alignnone" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/baby-amazed-scared-laughing-1.gif" alt="baby-amazed-scared-laughing-1" width="295" height="222" /></a></p>
<h2>Outcome based quizzes</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/png.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-65 alignnone" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/png.png" alt="png" width="414" height="347" /></a></p>
<p>We’ve all seen the “What kind of X am I?&#8221; quizzes blowing up and taking over our feeds. Now you can build your own on Qzzr. You can even map multiple results to each answer. For instance, if you were trying to identify a favorite ninja turtle you could ask if the weapon is made of metal or wood. Donatello would be on wood and the rest would be mapped to metal. Easy!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.co/make/new">Try making a quiz</a></p>
<h2>Pro is on its way</h2>
<p>We have some features on the way that will help publishers and content marketers take their quizzes to the next level.</p>
<h3>Better embeds that drive shares</h3>
<p>Make a quiz, embed it, and have it drive shares back to your own site. As much as we love the thousands of shares coming to our site we know that pros want the shares to drive more traffic to their site.</p>
<h3>Offer matching</h3>
<p>We can help you find the patterns in the way people take quizzes signal that they’re ready for an offer. Quizzes are the ultimate lead qualification tool. If someone answered this way give them an offer, otherwise encourage them to share. You get the best of virality and offers.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41" style="max-width: 270px; margin: 0 auto;" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mobile-quiz-taking.png" alt="Mobile-quiz-taking" width="270" height="260" /></p>
<p><strong>More than a third</strong> of our quizzers were eschewing the formal computer for the more informal mobile device. The OS split was about what you&#8217;d expect. With Windows and Macintosh split evenly and iOS taking a slight lead over Android.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/OS-Distribution-of-Quizzers.png" alt="OS Distribution of Quizzers" width="548" height="402" /></p>
<p>Astonishingly our mobile segment was split across 34 devices.</p>
<p>What does all this tell us?</p>
<p><strong>People want to quiz on mobile!</strong> They want to quiz from the couch, from the bus (hopefully not while driving), they want to quiz while waiting in line. They want to learn and test their knowledge everywhere. Remember when your job made you take a test last year and it was only compatible with Internet Explorer 8? That&#8217;s dead. It became a totally unacceptable state of affairs years ago but assessment hasn&#8217;t caught up until Qzzr.</p>
<p>Break out your favorite mobile device and go try out a Quiz, how&#8217;s it working for you? We&#8217;d love to have your feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Saturday night live quiz" href="http://www.qzzr.co/quiz/2">Are you a Saturday Night Live Fan?</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Test.  Exam.  Quiz.  Educational assessment.  How do those words make you feel?</h2>
<div>
<p>A number is a powerful thing.  It can be used to give exact measurement.  It can say what 1000 words can’t.  It can easily be compared to other numbers.  It can also be used to beat people over the head.  Somewhere along the way, the idea of feedback in the learning process became punitive.</p>
<h2>A relevant human experience</h2>
<p>Seeking feedback is a profoundly relevant human experience.  If our mere existence as humans is to progress, then feedback is what makes that existence relevant.   We are constantly seeking feedback to understand our surroundings.</p>
<p>Is this safe? What time do I need to wake up?  How long will it take me to brush my teeth?  Does he like me?  Why are they looking at me like that?  Can I play this song again without a making a mistake?  Have I done my good deed for the day?</p>
<p>Feedback is a necessary and natural part of growth.  Therefore, feedback is a necessary part of learning.</p>
<h2>Growth doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</h2>
<p>Everything happens in relation to its context.  You can’t understand growth unless you can relate it to or measure it against something.</p>
<p>How do you know if you’ve grown taller?  You can’t feel it.  You can see it in a mirror or picture, but can’t tell unless you relate it to something.  These pants look too short.  I’m taller than my sister now.  I can now see on top of the refrigerator….yuck…let’s clean it.</p>
<p>To understand growth in learning we must have feedback just like to understand the growth of our body we must have a mark on the wall.  It’s all feedback.  It’s all necessary.</p>
<h2>Feedback is not evil, evil is.</h2>
<p>The question is….how do we feel about it?  Do we get nervous when we step up to the wall to measure ourselves?  Do we agonize for days in advance?  Do we resent the lower marks on the wall?  Of course not.  In fact, it’s just the opposite.  We’re eager to see how we’ve grown.  We’re proud of progress.  We’re completely satisfied by looking at those lower marks because they tell us how far we’ve come.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t assessment in the learning process feel as rewarding as measuring our height on the wall?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>“Wait…no it doesn’t.  I get physically sick with sweaty palms when I have to take a test.”</p>
<p>Aha!  Why?  Let’s explore this.  This is getting good.  Think for a moment.  What are you good at?  What do you like learning about?  What do you spend your time doing?</p>
<p>Do you have a few topics?</p>
<p>Now….what if someone started asking you questions about those things?  How would that feel?  Would you enjoy that conversation?  Absolutely.  It would be invigorating talking about things you love or are passionate about.  In fact, you would probably know all of the answers to just about any question on the topic.</p>
<p>What if that person asking the questions was keeping track of how many questions you could answer correctly and telling you how impressed they were along the way?  Would that bother you?  Not at all.  It would feel good.</p>
<p>What if sent a link to a quiz on one of your favorite topics?  Would you be nervous to take it?  Not at all.  You would probably stop what you were doing immediately and take it.  It would be fun.</p>
<p>Aren’t those examples above some form of assessment, just like an exam, test, or quiz?</p>
<p>So why do some forms of assessment make you physically sick and other forms excite you feel good?  Because feedback is not evil, evil is.  Feedback is something necessary that we crave.  We seek it out.  We thrive on it.  And sometimes, we even enjoy it.  Any negative feelings around feedback come from evils perpetuated by a system or our own personal baggage.  More on this later.</p>
<p>How do we make all assessment useful, instructive, and enjoyable?  It has everything to do with agency and the power of questions.  And that would be an excellent topic for our next blog post.  Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Qzzr is our answer to the combined experiences of our life and careers.  Collectively we have been public school teachers, entrepreneurs, sunday school teachers, managers of people, parents, coaches, school of rock founders, corporate trainers, keynote speakers, lifelong learners, thought leaders in online learning, designed and built learning tools for dozens of Fortune 500 companies, and creators of the world’s foremost social learning platform.  We’ve seen this problem from every angle.</p>
<p>When we started <a href="http://movementventures.com/">Movement</a>, a hatchery for great ideas, we really expected that our first product would be placed somewhere outside of the world of online learning since Josh’s last two companies have been in that space.  We started with over 70 ideas or problem spaces that we wanted to explore.  As we began validating ideas and testing markets we explored physical products, ecommerce company concepts, gas stations, and recruiting apps, but there was this one idea that kept suggesting to us that there was something left to be said and we needed to say it.  Qzzr.</p>
<h2>Why quizzes?</h2>
<p>It’s really more about feedback than quizzes specifically.  We feel like something needs to be said about feedback in the learning process and how to measure progress.  The idea of assessment has been given a bad rap by people who have the wrong idea.  It’s become punitive, not additive.  So, we’re standing up for feedback.  Feedback is a natural human desire and an inescapable part of the learning process.  The right feedback can encourage learners to dive deeper and illuminate the path for teachers and stakeholders.  And like any great teacher, we’re starting in a place everyone understands and aim to take them on the journey with us.   More on this later.</p>
<h2>Our aim</h2>
<p>We aim to show the world what learning feedback needs to look like.  Along that journey, we will provide the world’s simplest and most flexible tool for doing so.  It will always work on any device.  It will always be beautiful, wildly shareable, secure,  and dead simple to use.  It will never require special software or downloads.  There will always be a robust free version that anyone can use as well as a premium version for those who need special features.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning.  A starting place.  We invite you on this journey along with us to provide the us feedback we need to provide you the feedback you need.</p>
