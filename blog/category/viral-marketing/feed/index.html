				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/man-791505_1280.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1768" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/man-791505_1280-300x200.jpg" alt="man-791505_1280" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Independence Day is this weekend and—between backyard barbecues and firework shows—many individuals will be sitting back and enjoying some free time. And what do we do when we’ve got an afternoon to waste? We get on the Internet.</p>
<p>You will see all walks of life posting to your favorite social media channel during the Fourth of July weekend. Between uploading family photos and researching the perfect fried chicken recipe, everyone is bound to skim through Facebook to peek into the lives of everyone else they know.</p>
<p>Capitalize on this social media mayhem by posting the perfect, engaging US history quiz. You will need to find a balance between holiday fun and industry relevance, but if you walk that line just right, your engagement is sure to spike.<span id="more-1766"></span></p>
<p>Need some help getting started? Here is a list of conversation-starting, thought-provoking Independence Day quiz ideas that will capture your proud customers on everyone’s favorite summer weekend!</p>
<h3>1. How Much Do You Know About US History in Pop Culture?</h3>
<p>Everyone loves a bit of pop-culture trivia. Capture audiences young and old with this engaging quiz idea where everyone can participate. Where does Independence Day appear in iconic films? Which books have used Independence Day in the plot? Get families talking about their favorite cultural stars and recommending must-see movies after a few fun questions. This taxing US history quiz is bound to dominate social media with its shareable facts and goading headline.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which Star Trek character quotes the Preamble in episode 52 of the original series, “The Omega Glory?” A: Captain Kirk</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3b56e0u0EgQ" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>2. Which Founding Father Are You?</h3>
<p>This quiz headline isn’t particularly unique, but it is catchy. In fact, as I was researching this quiz idea, I found myself taking one of the many founding father quizzes out there. In case you were wondering, I’m Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a quiz doesn’t need to be one-of-a-kind, it just needs to be memorable and timely. And what is more relevant and shareable than a personality quiz that makes people feel proud to be an American?</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>One question I thought was funny from the quiz I took was:</p>
<p>Q: How tall are you?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Fairly tall</li>
<li>Fairly short</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too old to care</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too busy fighting duels to measure</li>
</ol>
<p>(Take the quiz and share your results with us in the comments!)</p>
<h3>3. Is This Tradition From the United States or Britain?</h3>
<p>Inspire the proud American in everyone on Independence Day with a quiz that highlights the differences between the United States and our motherland. You can look at how the two countries have changed, the silly laws we kept and changed over the years, the differences in holiday traditions, and any other funny facts that will interest quiz takers. Here are some examples.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which country participates in “worm charming” to collect bait for fishing? A: <a href="http://listverse.com/2010/04/02/10-very-strange-british-traditions/" target="_blank">Britain</a>: The competition was initiated by local man Tom Shufflebotham who on July 5, 1980, charmed 511 worms from the ground in only half an hour. The game has been held every year since as a world championship. The competition has 18 rules. Music of any kind can be used to charm worms out of the ground, but no drugs can be used. Water is considered to be a drug.</p>
<p>Q: Which country uses more pumpkins to celebrate Halloween each year? A: <a href="http://www.anglotopia.net/british-identity/lost-pond-5-major-differences-english-american-halloween-traditions/" target="_blank">The United States</a>: Illinois alone uses around 500 million a year, the UK uses about 4 million a year in total.</p>
<h3>4. How Many Americans Are Actually American?</h3>
<p>Ever wondered how American you really are? The United States has long been dubbed a melting pot for different cultures, and the actual breakdown of where today’s population originated from is interesting, and sometimes shocking. Remind quiz takers of their origins and perhaps inspire people to appreciate their culture and this great country in which we live.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: True or False? Research has found that more than 6 million Americans who self-identify as European likely carry African ancestry. A: <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/21/americans-mixed-ancestry/" target="_blank">True</a>: A study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics found this to be true, and that as many as 5 million self-described European Americans might have at least 1 percent Native American ancestry as well.</p>
<h3>5. Lies US History Taught Us: Are You Smarter Than James Loewen?</h3>
<p>Want a little controversy? This time of year, we like to pull out facts from our arsenal of American history—but how much history do we really know? The bestselling book written by James Loewen in 1995, called Lies My Teacher Told Me, outlines a number of inaccuracies in our most popular history textbooks, particularly about the settling of the United States and the idealization of national heroes. Test your followers’ US history knowledge with interesting facts and ideas inspired by Loewen. You’ll give quiz takers some food for thought and establish yourself as an edgy, knowledgeable source.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: According to Lies My Teacher Told Me, how much more do American clothing workers make than their Malaysian counterparts? A: <a href="https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/loewen.html" target="_blank">1,500 times more</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Holidays are a great time to take advantage of the social engagement that quizzes offer. Take advantage of your potential customers’ free time and grab their attention with something funny, interesting or controversial, but always shareable.</p>
<p>Happy Independence Day!</p>
<p>Want some inspiration? Here&#8217;s a great US history quiz that has been taken over 140,000 times!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you too have been infected by the TV show Suits, you’ll recognize these all-too-common progressive symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch one episode of Suits</li>
<li>Obsess about Suits</li>
<li>Develop unsettling, yet secure man/woman-crush on Harvey Specter</li>
<li>Glance at your watch to realize it’s 4AM and you have a meeting in four hours</li>
<li>Watch one more episode</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve caught much of the show, you’ll know that Harvey is the kind of guy that says the exact right thing at the exact right time.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking, isn’t that exactly what I try to do as a content creator? <span id="more-1756"></span>And isn’t that commonality enough to create a lasting friendship that could include regular recreational activities together, like—I don’t know—driving cool cars, trying on <img class="  wp-image-1758 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NUP_143654_1381.jpg" alt="NUP_143654_1381.tif" width="369" height="208" />expensive suits, messing with Louis…</p>
<p>FOCUS, Coy! Sorry, back to my point. Harvey got where he is for a reason (and no, that’s not just because someone wrote that into a script). So I pulled the ten best Harvey Specter quotes and packaged them here for your content marketing enlightenment.</p>
<h3>The Top 10 Best Harvey Specter Quotes on Content Marketing</h3>
<h4>&#8220;I don&#8217;t pave the way for people&#8230; People pave the way for me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Success and innovation almost always go together, so move early and move fast. If you’re standing still, you’ll likely get passed over or lost in the fray. <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/23/attention-economy" target="_blank">There’s a finite amount of attention out there</a>, so only the most unique, best produced content even has a shot at being seen. Is Harvey the kind of guy that would throw together a sloppy blog post? Are you serious? I oughta slap you for even considering it.</p>
<h4>“I don’t play the odds, I play the man.”</h4>
<p>You didn’t know Harvey was into personalized marketing, did you? If there’s one thing you know about Harvey and Mike Ross, it’s that every situation and case is tirelessly researched. They don&#8217;t go into any scenario blindly (with a few disastrous exceptions), and eventually it’s a silver bullet of uncovered information that makes the difference.</p>
<p>Find out what makes your customer tick, then give them what they want—even if they themselves don’t know it yet.</p>
<h4>“That&#8217;s the difference between you and me—you wanna lose small, I wanna win big”</h4>
<p>Win big by finding out what works and then go in for the jugular. How do you do this? Research and testing, my friend.</p>
<p>Do those take time? Absolutely. Are they pleasant? Not always. But do they pay off? In spades. One example showed that testing even just the copy on a button <a href="http://copyhackers.com/2014/09/buttons-vs-headlines/" target="_blank">resulted in a 123% improvement</a> on clickthrough rate. I’d call that winning big, wouldn’t you?</p>
<h4>“It’s not bragging if it’s true.”</h4>
<p>Stop waiting for other people to talk about your successes—it may not happen. Potential customers need to know why they should give their time and money to you, and if they can’t find a reason, they’re gone. If you haven’t noticed, Harvey is not afraid to point out the fact that he’s the best, and I can’t remember one example of a client leaving to another firm (and staying there—if I’m wrong, let me know in the comments).</p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean you have to be insufferable about it, as Harvey occasionally is. While confidence and bravado are celebrated characteristics in high-powered NYC corporate law, you may not be able to get away with it in your space. Tout your strengths and showcase your wins, but do so tactfully.</p>
<p>And what’s even better than shouting your own praises? Having someone else tout them for you. A pleased-as-punch customer of ours recently wrote a guest post on the Uberflip blog, detailing the quiz they created, how they promoted it, and how it has <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/95454123-how-one-quiz-generated-a-million-dollars" target="_blank">generated over $1.1 million in revenue</a>.</p>
<h4>&#8220;Loyalty is a two way street. If I&#8217;m asking for it from you, then you are getting it from me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Love this one. It speaks to the symbiotic nature of companies and customers. As marketers, there is no greater goal than earning loyal customers—the kind that keep coming back time and again. However, as consumers, we value the types of businesses that listen and move to meet customer requests. It’s a complex dance in which neither party can become complacent or stationary, and every touch point is a new opportunity to strengthen or weaken that relationship.</p>
<h4>“I don’t have dreams—I have goals.”</h4>
<p>Dreams are what you spend hours thinking about, and goals are what you work tirelessly to achieve. How do you set the right kind of powerful, challenging goals? One great formula is that of <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/How-to-Set-SMART-Marketing-Goals-for-2013-TEMPLATE.aspx" target="_blank">SMART goals</a>, which says that goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Bound.</p>
<p>As an example, we set a goal in May to double the amount of <a href="http://go.qzzr.com/ebook-are-you-a-qwizard/?utm_campaign=qwizardebook&amp;utm_source=suits&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank">“Are You a Qwizard?” ebook</a> downloads, and then rolled out some new strategies to promote it. We ended up with more than a 295% increase in May, so we learned a lot about what was realistic.</p>
<h4>“I don&#8217;t get lucky. I make my own luck.&#8221;</h4>
<p>The man makes his own luck, ladies and gentlemen. Spectacular.</p>
<p>But that’s not altogether impossible. In sports, luck is thrown around a lot. “That shot was lucky” or “They got lucky” or “That was a lucky break.” Well, a lot of hard work and preparation goes into getting to the point where luck can enter into the equation.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors hadn’t done anything much more than yawn-worthy in more than 20 years. But try and tell Steph Curry that their NBA title was lucky.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="max-width: 100%;" src="//giphy.com/embed/laEnlnMj27drW" width="480" height="269" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Suits doesn’t usually do much more than allude to the hours of research and discovery that goes into their cases (if they showed it, it would be more like CSPAN, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we</span> nobody would watch it). While it’s true that you can catch a lucky break from time to time, if you’re relying on those moments to carry your marketing performance, you’re not going to last long.</p>
<h4>&#8220;The only time ‘success’ comes before ‘work’ is in the dictionary.”</h4>
<p>See above.</p>
<p>Man, Harvey can say pretty much the same thing and it still sounds so cool.</p>
<h4>“Anyone can do my job, but no one can be me.”</h4>
<p>Be irreplaceable. There are more than a million people in the US with the exact same degree, but only Harvey can be Harvey. Again, I’m aware that it’s a fictional program—but you and I both know people that have the same degree or experience that we do, but have been able to parlay that into mountainous success.</p>
<p>Look at this from a branding perspective, whether that’s from a corporate or personal standpoint. Being human is a good thing, and being yourself is even better. Brands that successfully humanize their voice enjoy more success on social media, and that translates into improved performance overall. <a href="https://moz.com/blog/4-ways-to-build-trust-and-humanize-your-brand" target="_blank">Moz has a phenomenal guide</a> to humanizing your brand.</p>

<p>There you go. There&#8217;s no limit to what these Harvey Specter quotes can help you achieve. You now have an unbreakable excuse to watch Suits at work :).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your best content falls in the woods, does it have any value?</p>
<p>It does you little good to create the best content on Earth if no one is going to find it. So we wanted to come up with a go-to promotion strategy for marketing quizzes and other forms of interactive content. <span id="more-1709"></span></p>
<p>We’ve taught you <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to create great content</a>, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">how to find images</a> for it, and even <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/guide-for-global-quiz-domination/" target="_blank">how to use it to take over the world</a>. So what’s the next step? Spreading the word, obviously. You’re smart, you know the basics—stick it on Facebook and Twitter, put it on your blog, send it out through your newsletter. But what about the secrets, the things that set masters apart from amateurs? Well, that’s what we’re here for. We&#8217;ve picked up a few promotion strategy tricks along the way, and would love to share them with you.</p>
<p>First, a disclaimer: depending on who your customer or market is, your promotion strategy will be different. Not everything in this post will work for everyone, so instead of offering a to-do list, we offer this list as a toolbox, letting you choose your own tools for the job at hand.</p>
<p>Now that that’s over, let us introduce you to your new go-to resources for content promotion strategy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1712 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png" alt="1" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Have awesome content</h3>
<p>The first step, albeit obvious, must be stated: promoting content rests on the prerequisite of having content that’s worth promoting. What makes that? Good ideas, eye-catching headlines, captivating images. You’re already salivating just thinking about it, we know. And if you’re planning on using a quiz or two, check out our tips on <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to make it sweet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1713 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png" alt="2" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Use who you know</h3>
<p>Take advantage of the people that already know you and like you. Not in a bad way, more in a you-liked-that-one-thing-so-let-me-show-you-something-kind-of-like-it type of way. This means any way your brand has of reaching customers, like social media, newsletters, and blogs.</p>
<p>Anywhere you have an audience that’s already shown they’re interested in what you have to say, put your content there! Since newsletter subscribers and blog viewers are fairly self-explanatory, we’ll focus mainly on how to reach your social followers. It doesn’t matter which social media platform you use most—whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, or Pinterest—something here applies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1711 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png" alt="3" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h4>Post it!</h4>
<p>Once it goes live, make sure it goes out. On sites that allow it, use hashtags that work well in your industry; you can find them using sites like <a href="hashtagify.me" target="_blank">hashtagify.me</a> and check their effectiveness with <a href="ritetag.com" target="_blank">Rite Tag</a>. Tag the inspiration for your content or anyone you feature (we’ll talk more about this later).</p>
<h4>Post it again&#8230;and again</h4>
<p>When the internet gets over 9,000 new tweets and 2,000 new Instagram photos per second, how do you get your posts noticed? The easy solution is to post more. Here’s a few tips straight out of the Qzzr playbook:</p>
<p>Twitter: On publish, 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months<br />
Facebook: On publish, 3 days, 1 week<br />
LinkedIn: On publish, 1 week<br />
Google Plus: On publish, 1 week</p>
<p>We know what you’re thinking though: what if your followers get annoyed? Guy Kawasaki doesn&#8217;t think so—in <a title="Guy Kawasaki’s 12-Part Social Media Strategy Template" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/guy-kawasaki-social-media-strategy-template/" target="_blank">a recent webinar </a>we did with him, <strong>he asserted that the potential for a few lost followers is well worth the risk</strong>.</p>
<p>However, facing that risk head-on may be more than you can handle. One trick is to present something different with each post, a tidbit that educates anyone who reads it, whether or not they click on your link. Never post the exact same thing twice. A few ways to introduce that variety:</p>
<p><strong>Tweet the title</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz (and How to Make it Viral)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pose a question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Of all the forms of content out there, why should you use quizzes and how do you make a killer one?</li>
</ul>

<li>How to make it viral: get five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher to share it.</li>
</ul>

<li>Did you know: The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mention influencer</strong></p>

<h4>Time it right</h4>
<p>But what’s the use of posting and posting again if no one sees it? You have to post when the most people are online.</p>
<p>To schedule, use something like <a href="hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite </a>or <a href="www.tweetdeck.com" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a>. For ideas about optimal posting times, here’s what we’ve picked up in our adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>More posts/day = more engagement</li>
<li>Most blog post shares happen on Thursday</li>
<li>For the most Facebook clicks, post at 1:00pm or 3:00pm on Thursday or Friday—for the most shares, post Saturday afternoon</li>
<li>For Twitter, 5:00pm weekdays or anytime weekends is best</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pin it</h4>
<p>You’re probably thinking Pinterest, but you can pin posts in Twitter too (in Facebook, it’s called highlighting). This means anyone who looks at your profile will see these posts first.</p>
<h4>Feature your image</h4>
<p>Pinterest &amp; Instagram are image-based websites, but that doesn’t mean you should neglect photos on your other accounts. Facebook thinks posts with photos are more “important,” which makes them more likely to appear in newsfeeds, and a tweet with an image is much more noticeable than all-text.</p>
<p>We like using stock photos under the Creative Commons license (you can find photos <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">at these websites</a>) and then editing them using <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>.</p>
<h4>Post in groups</h4>
<p>If your business is B2B or if content is directed to a very niche community, posting to groups is essential. Find Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, and Google+ communities whose members would benefit from what you’re posting. Here at Qzzr, we usually try to find two or three groups on each website that are relevant.</p>
<h4>Expand your reach</h4>
<p>Last but not least, you can always draw more eyes by paying for views, if you’re so inclined. The great thing about this is the control you have over who you’re targeting—people who are similar to your current audience, age range, demographic, etc.</p>
<h3>Find people who want to know you</h3>
<p>If you have valuable content (and of course you do), it&#8217;ll mean something to others as well. So your job is to seek out these others and let them spread your words and images to other people in the industry as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1714 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png" alt="promotion post" width="900" height="900" /></a></p>
<h4>Bloggers &amp; influencers</h4>
<p>Find the bloggers and influencers who write about your topic and find your content valuable. But remember: someone needs a reason to read, retweet, or recommend whatever it is you send them—and sometimes, they even need a reason to open the email you send them. As Alex Turnbull, the founder of Groove, <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/1000-subscribers" target="_blank">quotes</a>, “No one cares about your content unless they care about you.”</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a catch-22: how do you make people care about your content if you don’t email them? But why would they open your emails if they don’t care about you? The secret is to start building the relationship and the conversation before you need it. Start interacting with influencers by commenting thoughtfully on their posts, retweeting their content, and then emailing them personally after they&#8217;ve seen your name and responded a few times. It’s time consuming but it’s definitely worth it.</p>
<p>You can find bloggers or influencers (people with big followings who share content similar to yours) through any of several sites. Some focus on different social platforms, and others, like BuzzSumo, are multi-purpose—you can find bloggers and Twitter influencers.</p>
<p><a href="http://BuzzSumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Topsy.com" target="_blank">Topsy.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Alltop.com" target="_blank">Alltop.com</a><br />
<a href="http://WeFollow.com" target="_blank">WeFollow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Twellow.com" target="_blank">Twellow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://CircleCount.com" target="_blank">CircleCount.com</a></p>
<h4>Blogger communities</h4>
<p>Similar but sometimes more effective (results will vary), you can also submit your article to mass communities of bloggers like:</p>
<p><a href="http://triberr.com/pages/stream.php" target="_blank">Triberr</a><br />
<a href="http://www.socialbuzzclub.com/" target="_blank">Social Buzz Club</a><br />
<a href="http://bizbloggingbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Biz Blogging Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://viralcontentbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Viral Content Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://www.justretweet.com/" target="_blank">Just Retweet</a><br />
<a href="https://izea.com/" target="_blank">Izea</a></p>
<p>Izea is a site that doesn’t really fit in this category because it functions differently. It’s a paid service where brands can find and pay social media content creators to feature their products/content. It worked well for Zenni Optical (made them <a title="The Anatomy of the Million Dollar Quiz [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/million-dollar-quiz-revenue/" target="_blank">over $1 million!</a>).</p>
<h4>Link roundups</h4>
<p>Link roundups are another way to get your content out there. Many bloggers send out daily or weekly newsletters with a list of their favorite articles or links around the web. For example, <a href="https://mattermark.com/category/mattermark-daily/">Mattermark</a> and <a href="http://foundcy.com/">Foundcy</a> do this with startup-related content. Google something like “link roundup” or “weekly link roundup” along with a category name, and email the organizer.</p>
<h4>Forums and submissions</h4>
<p>Submit post to relevant chains. Find a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">reddit</a> that’s similar to what you do. Or, if you&#8217;re in a very popular or large industry like startups or tech, you can submit to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a> for tech or <a href="http://inbound.org/">Inbound.org</a> and <a href="https://growthhackers.com/">Growth Hackers</a> for marketing. Forums are also a good niche place to send your content to—just find ones that apply to you and are made up of audiences that would find value in what you post. And just like with bloggers and influencers, it&#8217;s best to have a good standing within the group before you start posting.</p>
<h3>Put yourself out there</h3>
<p>Curation and aggregation get confused a lot. The easiest way to distinguish the two? Aggregation is usually automatic or, at least, not filtered based on any standard of quality, just amassed by keywords. Curated content is manually selected by someone and usually republished by that person with fresh insights, a new headline, or personal commentary. In other words, aggregation is collecting, while curation is choosing what&#8217;s in that collection. Both are great for submitting to to expose a wider audience to what you&#8217;re writing or making.</p>
<h4>Content curation platforms</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of popular content curation platforms across the web. (We debated keeping <a href="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis/confirm">Digg</a> on the list, but it seems to have passed its hey-day. No harm in submitting there anyways though, right?)</p>
<p><a href="stumbleupon.com" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a><br />
<a href="http://www.scoop.it/" target="_blank">Scoop.it</a><br />
<a href="http://paper.li/" target="_blank">Paper.li</a><br />
<a href="https://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a></p>
<p>The website that we&#8217;re most familiar with on the list is StumbleUpon, so we&#8217;ll stick with giving you advice on that one. First, you submit the page by logging into your StumbleUpon account. Stumblers love things like videos, tutorials, infographics, images, and lists. Interactive is even better—quizzes, anyone? If you&#8217;re serious about getting &#8220;stumbles,&#8221; add a StumbleUpon badge to your page to increase organic traffic, and share StumbleUpon&#8217;s custom URL on your social media. Lastly, you can track analytics—the views and likes on your submitted piece—by clicking on the &#8220;Your Likes&#8221; portion of your profile.</p>
<h4>Content aggregators</h4>
<p>Here are a few aggregators that cover different topics. Same as the curation platforms, most of them require you to create an account before submitting content.</p>
<p><a href="alltop.com" target="_blank">AllTop.com</a><br />
<a href="affposts.com" target="_blank">AffPosts.com</a><br />
<a href="affbuzz.com" target="_blank">AffBuzz.com</a><br />
<a href="affdaily.com" target="_blank">AffDaily.com</a></p>
<h3>Get discovered</h3>
<p>Content discovery/syndication networks are the ones that “suggest” more content from you whenever you’re on a publisher site like CNN, Time Magazine, or National Geographic. The most well-known content discovery networks are <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/">Outbrain</a> and <a href="http://taboola.com/">Taboola</a>—both of them offer analytics, allow geographical targeting, and strive to drive organic traffic.</p>
<p>The choice of what to use is yours, but here are a few general tips:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Make your page easy to share. The whole point of having your content &#8220;discovered&#8221; is the organic traffic that comes with it—along with the organic shares. Are your share buttons always visible and accessible to the user?</li>
<li>Try to get more out of every person who visits your site. Ask for, at best, an email (maybe in exchange for premium content like an ebook) or, at worst, a Facebook like or Twitter follow.</li>
<li>Build your retargeting audience. Use Google Analytics to build an audience based on the landing page for your Outbrain or Taboola campaign. This way, anyone who&#8217;s visited your site as a result of content discovery will see your ads as they continue to search the web, keeping you in their mind for the extent of their web-surfing duration.</li>
<li>Test-launch your content. You can use discovery networks to test different headlines against each other, like a soft launch or A/B testing. If you do this before a print run or making something premium content, it can save you a lot of time and money.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>Reuse what you have</h4>
<p>Why do more work than you have to? Republish &amp; repurpose your old content that works. Make an infographic, podcast, slideshare, or—even better—a quiz! Here’s a full list of things you can turn one high-performing post into:</p>
<p>Infographic<br />
Slideshare presentation<br />
<a href="http://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">Quiz</a><br />
<a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Poll</a><br />
Guest post<br />
Webinar<br />
Ebook<br />
PDF<br />
Podcast<br />
Video<br />
Email course<br />
List</p>
<p>You can also straight republish your content on sites like Quora, LinkedIn, and Medium. Just remember to link back to your original content and make allowances to how it will affect analytics.</p>
<p>Well, that’s that! Let us know your successes or failures with any of these platforms in the comments—or if we&#8217;ve left anything major out of our content promotion strategy guide, let us know. And if you want to hear about a quiz-specific success story, learn how <a href="http://www.internetmarketinginc.com/blog/case-study-million-dollar-quiz/" target="_blank">IMI made a quiz for Zenni Optical that generated a million dollars</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all seen them on our social feeds (and if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves, we&#8217;ve taken many of them).</p>
<p>In fact, quizzes have long been the most shared form of content on the web. In January, quizzes made up nine of the top ten most shared stories on Facebook—that&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p>But how do you tap into that power and create the type of quiz social natives flock to?</p>
<p>We met up with NUVI today to take on this challenge. You see, there&#8217;s something about quizzes that get people talking. They can&#8217;t keep from taking to Facebook and Twitter to display their scores and throw down a challenge to their friends and followers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Think you have what it takes to be an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenStack?src=hash">#OpenStack</a> Master? Take the OpenStack Challenge quiz to find out! <a href="http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2">http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2</a></p>
<p>— OpenStack (@OpenStack) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenStack/status/598540978350366720">May 13, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>See? I thought <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> was an amateur Jenga tournament, and even I want to take that quiz just to prove I&#8217;m a Master (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read" target="_blank">tl;dr</a>: I&#8217;m not a Master). Even if they&#8217;re not gloating or challenging, they&#8217;re chipping in on the conversation with opinions and tidbits. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForPaul?src=hash">#ForPaul</a> MT <a href="https://twitter.com/RomanciaSays">@RomanciaSays</a>: I think I got Paul&#8217;s car. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fast7?src=hash">#Fast7</a> <a href="https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC">https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/quizzes?src=hash">#quizzes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CarListerCo">@CarListerCo</a> <a href="http://t.co/kpcRPFlhJK">pic.twitter.com/kpcRPFlhJK</a> — TV After Dark (@TVAfterDark) <a href="https://twitter.com/TVAfterDark/status/600757086239072260">May 19, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you create and promote the right quiz, social media will erupt in conversation.<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://www.nuvi.com" target="_blank">NUVI</a> is a premier social listening tool that uses incredible data visualization to show you what people are saying about your brand. We use their tool daily at Qzzr, so we know how effective it can be.</p>
<p>But enough about that specifically. There was a wealth of knowledge shared in this webinar, from both the quiz creation and social promotion camps, so feel free to watch the video or flip through the slides. Ask any questions in the comments below, or hit us up on Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/qzzr_" target="_blank">@Qzzr_</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nuvi" target="_blank">@NUVI</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d prefer to read your tips, feel free to check out this guide on <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/celebrate-new-year-social-media-quizzes/" target="_blank">social media quiz creation</a>—but whatever you do, <a title="Nobody Will Take Your Social Media Quiz if You Make These 7 Boneheaded Quiz Mistakes" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/social-media-quiz-mistakes/" target="_blank">do NOT make these 7 boneheaded mistakes!</a></p>
<p>Watch the webinar—then go forth and create the quiz social media has been waiting for for years. Consider it a challenge. <img src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h2>Check it out</h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>As you may have noticed while we were presenting, we had some technical difficulties due to a drop in internet connection. This caused some problems with the original recording. But since we wanted to make sure you got the full account, we pulled from another webinar with nearly identical content, and spliced it with the awesome insights we got from Bill and the guys at NUVI. The NUVI art starts at the 37:24 mark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a> and Qzzr got together to talk about quizzes, content marketing, and going viral—and how to use tools from them to do all three. Our one-hour webinar (embedded below) gave a lot of great tips and hints, but the crème de la crème had to be the six steps to creating a sweet quiz from our Chief Qwizard Owen and BuzzSumo’s Stephen Walsh.</p>
<h5><a href="http://ctt.ec/2NAdM" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Click to Tweet your thanks to Stephen!</a></h5>
<p>So we thought, why not turn those steps into a step-by-step list in a blog post so you can refer to it again and again when you make a quiz? Let us give you the meat and potatoes—and if we leave you wanting more, our webinar’s always there for a listen.</p>
<p><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1599" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Why-quizzes--300x150.png" alt="Why quizzes- 6 steps to a sweet quiz" width="484" height="242" /></p>
<p>First questions first: why are quizzes the new golden child of content marketing? Sure, they’re a form of media. But why are they more popular than, say, infographics or surveys or a plain old blog post? It’s because quizzes are engaging and nourishing. We can interact with them and—lo and behold!—they interact back. They feed us by telling us things about ourselves. As humans, we are our own favorite subjects.</p>
<p>So to all the brands, marketers, and publishers out there: make us feel good about ourselves, make us laugh, and give us something to brag about. And when you do, we’ll interact like crazy—to the tune of 82% conversion rates.</p>
<h3><strong>The 6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Do your research</h4>
<p>The best quizzes come from content that gets shares—content that resonates with its readers, spawns controversy and questions, or is easily misunderstood. So making a great quiz comes from understanding the content. Look at your old content with a fresh eye. Lists, infographics, posts with lots of comments—why can’t they be turned into quizzes?</p>
<p>This is also where BuzzSumo comes in. <a href="http://buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">Using their tool</a>, you can search topics and websites (even adding “quiz” or “?” after the terms to limit your results to quizzes) and see what’s being shared across the internet. Stephen made a great point during the webinar that recycling content for quizzes from checklists or how-to’s is incredibly easy. Get an idea of what’s out there—and how you make it even better.</p>
<h4>2. Choose your quiz</h4>
<p>There are two types of quizzes: graded and outcome. Your graded quizzes have titles like “How well do you know ___“ or “Are you a ___ expert?” and outcome quizzes are more along the lines of “Which superhero are you?” and “What color is your personality?”</p>
<p>Graded quizzes are about making people feel good about their score and educating as you go along. Assign outcomes like “You got 90%! You’re a genius!!” rather than simply “You got 90%”, and use the feedback option in Qzzr when you’re creating a quiz to throw in more interesting facts.</p>
<p>Outcome quizzes, on the other hand, need shareworthy resolutions. They should be designed with results that make people feel good and look good by helping people define themselves, invoking awe or laughter, or helping people share how they want to look to their friends.</p>
<p>Something surprisingly often overlooked in quiz creation is the importance of the title. It’s the first thing your potential quiz taker will see—so make it good. Good content always needs to have a hook, and that hook for a quiz is the title. BuzzSumo can help by showing you the most popular quizzes (hint: a lot of them have “hardest” or “ultimate” in the title).</p>
<p>We’re big on interactive content here at Qzzr, so we want to ask you: do graded quizzes or outcome quizzes sound more appealing to you? Take the poll (made with our sister tool <a href="http://www.pollcaster.com">Pollcaster</a>) and see what other people chose.</p>
<p><iframe id="mv-widget-KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" src="https://api.movementventures.com/widget/poll/KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" width="500px" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h4>3. Strategize your call to action</h4>
<p>People use quizzes in content marketing for lots of reasons. So what’s yours? Are you trying to generate leads? Make a sale? Gain more newsletter subscribers? Get more traffic? Defining your reason for wanting a quiz determines the call-to-action, which in turn helps you design your quiz.</p>
<p>First, understand the persona of your audience. Use BuzzSumo to look into the space you’re targeting and find topic ideas. Always focus on what your audience cares about or what both you and your audience care about jointly—otherwise you lose them.</p>
<p>Next, define the outcomes of your quiz. Make it something that people are proud to share. And make sure your call to action, whether that’s putting in an email address or linking to another blog post, is related to that outcome.</p>
<h4>4. Make your quiz</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have a secret recipe for the perfect quiz (don’t worry—we’re working on it). But in the meantime, here are some guidelines for you to follow in your search for virality:</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something cool.</h5>
<p>Keep me engaged by asking me interesting questions (quality over quantity)</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something meaningful. And convince me it’s meaningful.</h5>
<p>Make me feel sufficiently assessed. I won’t believe that you really know who I am or who I should be if you’ve only asked me three questions.</p>
<h5>&gt; Feed me and give me something to brag about.</h5>
<p>Give me feedback. Tell me if I’m right or wrong and then give me something else interesting. And in the outcome, tell me more about myself.</p>
<h5>&gt; Make me laugh.</h5>
<p>This quiz is a perfect example of making people laugh. We usually suggest people make positive outcomes—this quiz went the opposite direction and made the outcomes hilariously offensive. It worked—it&#8217;s been taken over 200,000 times and people love sharing their [sometimes painful] results.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="22314"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h5>&gt; Make me an offer I can’t refuse.</h5>
<p>This ties back into the call-to-action. Basically, tell me who I am and then tell me why I want what you have to offer me, whether that’s another blog post to read, an offer or newsletter to sign up for, or a drawing to enter into.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1600" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Make-it...-300x150.png" alt="How do you make a sweet quiz? Use these tips" width="594" height="297" /></p>
<p>Make sure to use images. We’re visual beings and we want to be shown things. Equally important, images need to be licensed to be legal for commercial use. So if you’re a bit short on pictures, you can do a Google Image search and filter using Advanced Search to only find those labeled for reuse. For more info, see our post on <a title="Qzzr Answers: Images and Qzzr" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/images-qzzr/">Images and Qzzr</a>.</p>
<h5>5. Share your quiz</h5>
<p>Now that your quiz has been made, share it with the world! Put it on your blog and social media. BuzzSumo can also help you step up your game here too. Search your topic (or even rival quizzes on your topic) and click “View Sharers” for a certain piece of content. Find the influencers with high domain authority and retweet ratios who shared those pieces and ask if they’d be interested in sharing yours too.</p>
<h5>6. Learn, adapt, and improve it</h5>
<p>The best part of using Qzzr to make a quiz is the analytics that come with it. Test different quiz titles, questions, and outcomes to see what appeals to your target customer.</p>
<p>There you go—that’s the distillation of our webinar in partnership with BuzzSumo. Good luck going viral and merry quiz-making! We’ll leave you with a few last surprising facts we learned from Stephen and Owen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher sharing something is what it takes to make it viral.</li>
<li>The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
<li>The #1 NYTimes article in 2013 was a quiz. And in case that’s not recent enough for you, nine out of ten of the most shared stories on Facebook in January 2015 were quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more great tidbits you probably didn’t know (and to hear some of Owen’s terrible puns), listen to our webinar with BuzzSumo in its entirety.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve followed our blog for long, you’ve certainly heard about the Zenni Optical quiz that has blown up, producing incredible results. We’ve been riding the roller coaster with them, and we wanted to grab an opportunity to step back and analyze how it all happened.</p>
<p>Today we had <a href="https://vimeo.com/126620525" target="_blank">a great webinar with Becca James from Internet Marketing Inc</a> (IMI)—the agency behind the quiz—who took us through the quiz execution process, allowing us to reverse engineer the magic of a [nearly] million dollar quiz.</p>
<p><em>Edit (5/14/15): This quiz has now generated $1,020,660!</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ctt.ec/V35uO" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Click to Tweet your gratitude to Becca</a></strong></p>
<h3>The anatomy of the [nearly] million dollar quiz</h3>
<p>First things first, here’s the quiz we’re referring to:</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="7951"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>So how did this thing take off and generate nearly $1 million?</h4>
<h3>1. Goals</h3>
<p>As with any campaign, to reach amazing results, you need to start with goals. From a broader perspective, the four things that Zenni Optical wanted most out of their partnership with IMI were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase organic traffic</li>
<li>Improve search ranking</li>
<li>Increased brand awareness</li>
<li>Quality link building</li>
</ol>
<p>For this particular campaign, Zenni had developed a “<a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/trendy-eyeglasses" target="_blank">Hottest Trends</a>” landing page with eight frame styles on it, and they wanted IMI to help drive traffic to it. So, that’s where they started.</p>
<h3>2. Strategy</h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Strategy.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1550" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Strategy.jpg" alt="Zenni Strategy" width="997" height="527" /></a></h4>
<h4>Research and data</h4>
<p>Becca pointed out how important it is for them at IMI to build a foundation of data and insights before they move on to the creation process. What does this mean?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical research</span> — This included keyword research, an understanding of SEO practices and how this landing page was doing. It also included housekeeping items to make sure that the page was crawlable by Google.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conversational research</span> — It was important to not only know what keywords were at play, but what their consumers were saying. What were they looking for? What questions did they have? To achieve this, IMI plugged the keywords into a social listening tool, to provide audience insights. The one they use is NetBase, but there are many out there. What’s important is that you use one.</p>
<p>This is important because it tells you <strong>how people are talking about those keywords—</strong>it’s really valuable to know, because you’re studying how you can be a solution. Remember, the goal in content marketing is to provide meaningful information, and you can only do this if you know what meaning is to them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comparative research</span> — Ask these questions: What is your competitive landscape? What are you going up against? Where are consumers turning to right now to get their answers?</p>
<h4>Define target audience</h4>
<p>We touch on this in every insight, but it’s imperative to know your audience. And the best way to do this is by developing personas. To do this, you’ll compile your audience insights, demographic data and what you know about the brand to differentiate the key types of people that will end up being your customers. <strong>Developing personas is the number one rule of creating quizzes</strong>.</p>
<h4>Match personas to the outputs of the quiz</h4>
<p>Here’s why this is amazing—<strong>if you’re building a quiz, you want nothing more than for the people taking the quiz to get their result and say “Wow, that’s amazing.”</strong> You want the answer to ring so true that an instant rapport is built. BOOM—you have understanding and legitimacy.</p>
<p>There’s this magical self-identifying element to a really good quiz, or piece of interactive content. The customer experience goes from just finding a solution online to feeling like a personalized solution was created for them.</p>
<p>And that magic is manifested through two priceless results—brand affinity and organically driven conversion. Simply put—<strong>people love brands that make their lives better, and they’re willing to listen to them</strong>.</p>
<p>And there are the two greatest things you can offer in content marketing: (1) personalization and (2) a solution. A well crafted quiz offers both.</p>
<h4>Call to action</h4>
<p>After you’ve provided this for people, give them something to do about it. And make it as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>A note on design from IMI: If your quiz and landing page are synonymous in design and messaging, people will easily think that the landing page is still part of the quiz or that it’s personalized for them. <strong>Therefore, they feel like they’re engaging in a really special experience.</strong></p>
<h3>3. Promotion</h3>
<p>There is a massive clutter of content on the internet. The only definitive way that your content will be successful is an investment in promotion.</p>
<p>What’s the perfect mix of promotion? Becca broke their promotion strategy down into three categories:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Owned</span> — The quiz was promoted through any channel they had direct access to—these efforts included newsletters, banners on the homepage, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Earned</span> — Included in this category were social media channels and outreach to key influencers in their network. Some of these were fashion experts and outlets, as well as optometry publications and thought leaders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paid</span> — Content marketing is supposed to be primarily organic, but it’s important that, among the owned and earned, you use a mix of paid search, paid social and content amplification strategies. They paid for ads on Facebook, but they also used services like StumbleUpon, Outbrain, IZEA, and Taboola to push the quiz out and <strong>target it to specific audiences that would care about it</strong>.</p>
<h3>4. Results/Tracking</h3>
<p>In content marketing, it’s important to define success, and how you define success. What factors will determine that you’ve been successful? To gauge results well, you want a metric that you can track at every step down the conversion funnel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Results-Pipeline.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1549" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Results-Pipeline.jpg" alt="Zenni Results Pipeline" width="1037" height="502" /></a></p>
<h4>Visibility</h4>
<p>How many people saw your content? You’ll want to track page views, email opens, inbound links, and referral visitors.</p>
<h4>Engagement</h4>
<p>Engagement from content marketing is not as clear as that from PPC—you can’t just point to how much money you put in and how much money you got out.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s not to say that you can’t track your engagement. But you may need to be a little more creative about how you do it. What Becca decided to track was on on-page engagement and off-page engagement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-page engagement or quiz engagement</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How many people take the quiz?</li>
<li>How many finished the quiz?</li>
<li>How many lead conversions did they get? Emails? Click-throughs?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-01-at-5.12.13-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1548" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-01-at-5.12.13-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-01 at 5.12.13 PM" width="955" height="447" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-page engagement</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Was it liked?</li>
<li>Was it shared?</li>
<li>Did people leave positive comments?</li>
<li>Where does it rank on search engines?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Traffic and lead quality</h4>
<p>Behavior funnels are a great way to feel this out, because they illustrate the customer journey and speaks to the quality of the content. Using tools like Google Analytics, you can see what people do after they take the quiz. Do they continue on through your CTA like you ask them to? Or do they go somewhere else? Do they then continue on to conversion?</p>
<p>When we launched this webinar, we called it the Half Million Dollar Quiz. But since then, we realized that the new number is $909,738.06, with 533,538 unique visitors. That’s just under $1 million in revenue, and a 7,500% return on investment. Wow! That’s just incredible.</p>
<p>Another thing you’ll want to pinpoint is which channels were the most revenue-generating. For IMI, these were the top three sources of revenue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organic search: $104,924.34</li>
<li>Paid search: $73,393.06</li>
<li>Email: $73, 331.96</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Remember, content marketing is a long-tail form of marketing. If you do it right, your content will live for a long time, continually bringing in new business—this quiz is every bit as profitable now as it was when it was released. And by that I mean it&#8217;s <em>really </em>profitable.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled with how this quiz has turned out. In the end, the agency and brand (IMI and Zenni) win, the platform (Qzzr) wins, and the customers win—they had a really great experience that ultimately resulted in many of them purchasing products that they were very happy with.</p>
<p>And the relationship with the customer continues—you have their email addresses, but you also have a lot of valuable information about them that will allow you to continue to provide meaningful information and recommendations to your customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, what a great day. Earlier this afternoon, we hosted a webinar with an unbeatable duo – Guy Kawasaki and Peg Fitzpatrick. The two engagement moguls are co-authors of a book called The Art of Social Media, and joined us to share their social media strategy template.</p>
<h5><a title="Entrepreneur Quiz: Are You an Art of the Start Expert?" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/entrepreneur-quiz-art-of-the-start/" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Take Guy&#8217;s Art of the Start quiz</a></h5>
<p>If you’d like to check out the full video of today’s webinar, you can find it along with the slide deck at the bottom of this post. We’ll jump right into these 12 tips, but one quick anecdote is worth sharing :</p>
<p>At the outset of the webinar, before we dove into their tips, we threw in a quick plug for <a href="http://go.qzzr.com/half-million" target="_blank">another webinar we’re hosting tomorrow with Internet Marketing Inc</a>. These guys recently launched a quiz for Zenni Optical, and among other feats, the quiz has generated nearly $500,000 at the time of this writing.</p>
<p><em>Update 5/27/15: This quiz has now generated over $1 million. Incredible!</em></p>
<p>When we mentioned this in the webinar, Guy interrupted to say “How does a quiz generate half a million dollars in revenue? I want to understand that. Maybe I’ll give up social media and switch to quizzing. How does that work?”</p>

<h3>The Art of Social Media: a social media strategy template</h3>
<p>Guy and Peg laid out what could be the 12 best insights in today’s fast-paced, competitive social media landscape. The value held in these tips, if applied immediately, holds untold value for you and your brand.</p>
<h3>Think Tinder, not eHarmony</h3>
<p>When crafting your social media strategy, remember what environment you’re in. If we’re comparing social media to a dating service, it’s Tinder, not eHarmony.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eHarmony-vs-Tinder.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1539" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eHarmony-vs-Tinder.jpg" alt="eHarmony vs Tinder" width="632" height="542" /></a></p>
<p>eHarmony asks a thousand questions to really try and get to know you and the aspects about you that may or may not be compatible with potential matches.</p>
<p>Tinder, however, shows you a picture, and asks you to determine instantly whether you think that person is “Hot or not.” Swipe left to pass, or right to match and learn more. There’s not much more to it than that.</p>
<p>In your social media, remember that people are going to make an instant decision about whether they like what you’re providing or not. In one moment, they’ll swipe left to ignore and not follow, or swipe right to follow you, learn more, and interact further.</p>
<p>What does this mean? One, you need to make things as simple as possible. Don’t post an essay, post a quick snippet. Two, post something that is visually appealing, and that conveys quickly what you or your brand is about.</p>
<p>Start first with your avatar and cover photos. Both should convey three important things about you – that you’re likeable, trustworthy, and competent.</p>
<p>Avatars should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be a picture of your face</li>
<li>not be cropped – don’t take your face from a crowd</li>
<li>be asymmetric</li>
<li>be front-lit – you want them to be able to clearly see you</li>
</ul>
<p>For a brand, use your logo. Anything else doesn’t look quite as professional.</p>
<p>Cover photos should:</p>
<ul>
<li>tell a story that you want conveyed</li>
<li>use darker colors</li>
<li>be hi-res and optimized for the proper size</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add images to every post</h3>
<p>Every post that you throw out on social media should include an image. The only exceptions should be when you are responding to someone else’s post.</p>
<p>People are programmed to pick up visual cues before text. Your goal on social media – just like in every other endeavor – should be to stand out from the crowd. Take a look at the Twitter feed below. Where are your eyes naturally drawn?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/twitter-images.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1532" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/twitter-images.jpg" alt="twitter images" width="375" height="498" /></a></p>
<p>To the image, right? Regardless of how long the other people spent crafting the words and syntax of their posts, it’s the one with the image that stands out, and you can bet it’s the one most likely to get engagement.</p>
<p>Fun tip: Did you know you can share up to four images in a Tweet?</p>
<h3>Repeat your posts</h3>
<p>It goes against our gut instinct sometimes, but the best social media wizards know how powerful repeat posting can be.</p>
<p>It makes sense – not everyone is on social media at the same time. Night Owls are unlikely to catch a post or tweet that landed that morning, and vice versa for the Early Birds. Post your best content multiple times throughout the day to capture the must engagement.</p>
<p>Now, it’s something that you want to experiment on with your own account, but Guy shared that his sweet spot happens to be right at about eight hours. He’ll get almost the same engagement the second and third times he posts the same content as he does the first – sometimes even more! To him (and really to anyone) it’s a no-brainer. If he can post it once and get 1,200 likes, or three times and get 3,600, why wouldn’t he?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/repeat-posting.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1533" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/repeat-posting.jpg" alt="repeat posting" width="837" height="352" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you’re occasionally going to get some people that notice this and feel the need to call you out on it. Do not let that deter you. If you have to lose a couple of followers to gain another 100, it’s well worth it.</p>
<h3>Ensure Pin-ability</h3>
<p>Pinterest has become an incredible way to interact with and engage new people. In fact, in many ways, Pinterest is becoming the new Google. People flock to it not only to find new shoes, but to search for information. Make it easy for them to find you, and to share your content with the world.</p>
<p>One quick example of this is in images. Make sure that the content you are sharing has a compelling image that is easy to share. If you’re posting a blog post or page from your website, make sure that you set a featured image.</p>
<p>That will help ensure that people don’t end up sharing this type of image:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ensure-pinnability.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1534" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ensure-pinnability.jpg" alt="ensure pinnability" width="297" height="530" /></a></p>
<h3>Experiment constantly</h3>
<p>Social media changes every day, as does the way that people interact with it. So it’s 100 percent imperative that you test regularly to make sure that you’re adapting with it, and squeezing every bit of value out of it.</p>
<h3>Target with Facebook</h3>
<p>Use targeting features to deliver your content to the people that want it most. Do some research into your existing customers and Facebook fans – are they predominantly male or female? Do they live in the US or abroad? How old are they?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Target-Facebook.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1535" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Target-Facebook.jpg" alt="Target Facebook" width="749" height="459" /></a></p>
<p>Use any factors you can to determine who likes your stuff, and then target your outreach at more people like that. Offer valuable content to bring them in and convert.</p>
<h3>Go artisanal</h3>
<p>Did you know that you can get better Facebook reach by posting directly within Facebook, rather than scheduling and posting through another app? In many cases, it’s staggering how much of a difference it makes. Facebook now offers robust scheduling options, which makes it a lot easier to go directly with them.</p>
<h3>Order your Instagram filters</h3>
<p>This is a fun tip – did you know that you can rearrange your favorite Instagram filters by holding them down and dragging? This lets you put the ones you use most in the four prime real estate spots, saving time.</p>
<h3>Upload video to Facebook and embed everywhere</h3>
<p>Facebook has really been pushing the video thing lately. In fact, they’ve built a lot of their newsfeed algorithms to heavily favor native Facebook video over other video giants like YouTube and Vimeo.</p>
<p>In other words, if you upload video directly to Facebook, it’s likely to be seen twice as often as if you upload to YouTube and post the link in Facebook. Below you’ll see two examples of this. In the first picture, the video was uploaded to Facebook, and in the second, you’ll see a YouTube link.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Facebook-video-upload.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1536" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Facebook-video-upload.jpg" alt="Facebook video upload" width="712" height="554" /></a></p>
<p>If you can’t see, the first was seen over 30,000 times, while the second had only 13,000 views.</p>
<p>Both were posted within five minutes of each other. This is important to note for two reasons. One, it shows that the conditions were almost identical. He didn’t post one on a Sunday night and the other at noon on Tuesday. Two, it testifies once more to the power of repeat posting. Not one person complained that it was posted twice, and another 13,000 people saw the post as a result.</p>
<h3>Always be Canva-ing</h3>
<p>If you haven’t seen <a href="http://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>, you really need to check it out. Say you’re the type of person that felt overwhelmed when we urged every post to have an image – well Canva takes the stress out of creating images. It makes it incredibly easy to create beautiful graphics to share on social media, even giving you easy templates to use and formatting for optimized sizing by social network.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/canva.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1537" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/canva.jpg" alt="canva" width="889" height="430" /></a></p>
<p>Guy is the Chief Evangelist at Canva, and it’s easy to see how passionate he is about creating and sharing compelling images on social media.</p>
<h3>Try Periscope</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.periscope.tv" target="_blank">Periscope</a> is the instant video platform that was recently acquired by Twitter. Their tagline is “Explore the world through someone else’s eyes,” and their tool makes it easy to share instant video of whatever you’re doing – so whether that’s a protester in Ukraine or footage of a big company event, the results are incredibly engaging. It’s picking up some major steam, so check it out.</p>
<h3>SnapChat</h3>
<p>“I had a great tip on SnapChat for you, but it disappeared in 6 seconds, so it’s gone.” &#8211; Peg Fitzpatrick, ladies and gentlemen</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So that&#8217;s it. If you&#8217;d like more detail on these and more, pick up a copy of Guy and Peg&#8217;s book – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Social-Media-Power-Users/dp/1591848075/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430323796&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+social+media" target="_blank">The Art of Social Media</a>.</p>

<p>Are you bonkers for fun quizzes? You’re not alone—millions of people take these things every day. If you were to scroll down your Facebook feed right now, you&#8217;d probably be more likely to come across one than a food pic from even your most insufferable friend (you know which one I&#8217;m talking about).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charlie-chaplin-510160_6401.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-1521 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charlie-chaplin-510160_6401.jpg" alt="charlie-chaplin-510160_640" width="217" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>Did you plan the world’s best party, buy all the right snacks, and pick the perfect playlist—only to find that people are showing up, staying just long enough to eat your bean dip, and ducking out before you can say hello?</p>
<p>If your website has a high bounce or exit rate, it feels like that, doesn’t it? You’ve worked so hard to build value in your product and done everything right to bring people to you, but you’re losing them left and right.</p>
<p>First things first—what are bounce and exit rate? Simply put, they’re the rate at which people leave your page or site without diving deeper.</p>
<p>Don’t get discouraged—before you start thinking about jumping ship on your own site, roll out some of these tactics to turn things around and get people wanting more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to decrease your bounce rate in five easy steps.</p>
<h3>1. Know Your Visitor</h3>
<p>This is the Grand Central Station of the content strategy subway map, because every piece of advice starts here. There’s just nowhere else that even makes sense. It’s 100% imperative that you know who you are speaking to.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Know-Your-Visitor.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1520 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Know-Your-Visitor.jpg" alt="Decrease your bounce rate, know your visitor" width="933" height="562" /></a></p>
<p>Presumably, you already have personas identified from your product development, site design, and promotion—but if you don’t, I can guarantee that is likely the top reason people are not sticking around. Imagine throwing a big barbecue only to find out that your invite list was made up entirely of vegetarians—there’s just nothing you can offer them. Stop what you’re doing and find out who the right person is, and what they’re looking for.</p>
<h3>2. Think Like a User, Because You Are One!</h3>
<p>Think of all of the things that bother you when you’re on a new site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Where the **** is the shopping cart?”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I know they have a blog. Why isn’t it on the home page?”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“How does anyone read this text? I’m getting a migraine.”</em></p>
<p>It starts with the obvious, but usually goes much deeper. The pain points that users experience when they’re on your site are often far beneath the surface, unknown to even them.</p>
<p>A good tool to have in this instance is a heat map. With it, you’re able to see where people are scrolling and clicking on your site, which means you can track processes to see where people are getting held up. There are several out there, with different features and levels of intricacy.</p>
<p>At the moment, Crazy Egg is offering a <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/qzzr-60-days" target="_blank">60-day free trial just for our fans</a>, so you can try it out and get a good baseline upon which to improve.</p>
<h3>3. Better Content</h3>
<p>We all know how it feels to be disappointed by a movie we were so excited to see (I’m looking at you, Clooney, and <a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/markets-festivals/qa-joel-schumacher-on-batman-ben-affleck-and-the-batsuit-nipples-1201327631/" target="_blank">your nippled batsuit</a>). Don’t do that to your potential customers. The content you produce is almost always going to be the first thing people see when they come across your brand, and first impressions matter. You’re always a strike or two away from being filed away as a Nicholas Cage. And come on—nobody wants that.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SeH78.gif"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i.imgur.com/SeH78.gif" alt="Nicholas Cage bounce rate exit rate" width="380" height="136" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Calls-to-Action</h3>
<p>When you do have the right content, make sure you give readers something to do after. What you don’t want is for someone to come to your site, absorb what you have, and say “Well that was nice” and move on about their day. Talk about a wasted opportunity! If what you do matters, then don’t let potential customers get away without offering them a chance to do something about it.</p>

<p>There are so many ways to offer a call to action, so the best option for you will without question vary. Test, test, and test again to crack the code. There are some good companies out there that can help with this. We recently had a great webinar with Bounce Exchange, and they’ve had some killer successes on this front.</p>
<h3>5. Analytics</h3>
<p>Nine times out of ten, it’s going to come down to a numbers game. Your site analytics are going to offer hidden treasures of insight into the mystery of bounce and exit rate. Here are the best places to start looking, courtesy of <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/what-you-can-learn-from-bounce-rate-how-to-improve-it/" target="_blank">Kristi Hines</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Best “sticky” content</strong> – Find out what’s working and what’s not. When people land on your site, what are they loving? What are they running from? Use this information to produce more like your best, or to spruce up the worst.</li>
<li><strong>Best traffic sources</strong> – If Facebook referrals are bailing faster than mice at a cat bar mitzvah, then it may make sense to scale back your promotion there in favor of another source that may be performing better. But always compare this to conversion rates. If Facebook referrals end up converting more often, then change whatever you need to on the site to keep them there.</li>
<li><strong>Best keywords</strong> – What keywords are pushing people to your pages, and are they feeling fulfilled by what you offered them? Balance these two considerations to determine what elements to change. Either work harder for the fruitful keywords, or make sure that when people land on your site from that search, they’re getting what they were looking for.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>These are great tips to start with when trying to figure out how to decrease your bounce rate.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it’s going to be different for every site. If you know your product and audience, take a step back to think about what you need to create (or remove) to bring the two together.</p>
