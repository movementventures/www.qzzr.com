				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all seen them on our social feeds (and if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves, we&#8217;ve taken many of them).</p>
<p>In fact, quizzes have long been the most shared form of content on the web. In January, quizzes made up nine of the top ten most shared stories on Facebook—that&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p>But how do you tap into that power and create the type of quiz social natives flock to?</p>
<p>We met up with NUVI today to take on this challenge. You see, there&#8217;s something about quizzes that get people talking. They can&#8217;t keep from taking to Facebook and Twitter to display their scores and throw down a challenge to their friends and followers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Think you have what it takes to be an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenStack?src=hash">#OpenStack</a> Master? Take the OpenStack Challenge quiz to find out! <a href="http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2">http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2</a></p>
<p>— OpenStack (@OpenStack) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenStack/status/598540978350366720">May 13, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>See? I thought <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> was an amateur Jenga tournament, and even I want to take that quiz just to prove I&#8217;m a Master (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read" target="_blank">tl;dr</a>: I&#8217;m not a Master). Even if they&#8217;re not gloating or challenging, they&#8217;re chipping in on the conversation with opinions and tidbits. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForPaul?src=hash">#ForPaul</a> MT <a href="https://twitter.com/RomanciaSays">@RomanciaSays</a>: I think I got Paul&#8217;s car. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fast7?src=hash">#Fast7</a> <a href="https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC">https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/quizzes?src=hash">#quizzes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CarListerCo">@CarListerCo</a> <a href="http://t.co/kpcRPFlhJK">pic.twitter.com/kpcRPFlhJK</a> — TV After Dark (@TVAfterDark) <a href="https://twitter.com/TVAfterDark/status/600757086239072260">May 19, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you create and promote the right quiz, social media will erupt in conversation.<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://www.nuvi.com" target="_blank">NUVI</a> is a premier social listening tool that uses incredible data visualization to show you what people are saying about your brand. We use their tool daily at Qzzr, so we know how effective it can be.</p>
<p>But enough about that specifically. There was a wealth of knowledge shared in this webinar, from both the quiz creation and social promotion camps, so feel free to watch the video or flip through the slides. Ask any questions in the comments below, or hit us up on Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/qzzr_" target="_blank">@Qzzr_</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nuvi" target="_blank">@NUVI</a>.</p>

<p>Watch the webinar—then go forth and create the quiz social media has been waiting for for years. Consider it a challenge. <img src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h2>Check it out</h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>As you may have noticed while we were presenting, we had some technical difficulties due to a drop in internet connection. This caused some problems with the original recording. But since we wanted to make sure you got the full account, we pulled from another webinar with nearly identical content, and spliced it with the awesome insights we got from Bill and the guys at NUVI. The NUVI art starts at the 37:24 mark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lovethatshot.co.uk/icon-prom-from-love-that-shot-photography/"><img class="  alignright wp-image-1668" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/prom-couple.jpg" alt="prom-couple" width="360" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>A 5% lead conversion rate is a lot like asking your cousin to prom. Sure—it&#8217;s better than nothing, but you and I both know it could be a whole lot better.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s webinar, we sat down with Sushant Sharma of <a href="https://vwo.com/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a> to discuss how quizzes are driving killer conversion rates. To say it was a helpful conversation would be grossly inadequate. Read on to get a few insights into the process behind 20-30% conversion rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/marketing-quiz" target="_blank">As I recently discussed on the Wordstream blog</a>, we recently discovered that Qzzr quizzes ending with lead capture forms were successful at acquiring a lead 10% of the time. Yeah, that&#8217;s the average! It only took basic marketing prowess to get above average conversion rates.</p>
<p>What would you do if your conversion rates were that high?</p>
<p>Owen and Sushant shared countless quiz tips (and you really should watch the webinar below to get all of them), but we&#8217;ll highlight just three that will get you started:</p>
<h4>Know your audience</h4>
<p>Quizzes and polls are examples of interactive content, but without knowing who you&#8217;re designing the quiz for, there&#8217;s not going to be much interaction. Here&#8217;s a quick diagram that illustrates precisely the mindset you should be in when designing your quiz.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1669" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-29-at-12.03.14-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-29 at 12.03.14 AM" width="1074" height="603" /></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t do you a bit of good to create a quiz that only you would want to take. This seems obvious, but it&#8217;s remarkably common. Learn as much as you can about your target personas.</p>
<p>What challenges do they face? What entertains them? What do they want to learn more about? Maybe draw inspiration from the news or pop culture, depending on your audience. Find that happy middle where interaction flows naturally. Turn that prom date from awkward cousin conversation into riveting, engaging dialogue. That&#8217;s what spurs an above average conversion rate.</p>
<h4>Show me something cool</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png"><img class="  wp-image-1671 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png" alt="dogbounty" width="378" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Quizzes are by nature much more social than other forms of content. They&#8217;re personal. So ditch the office-speak and loosen the tie and have a little fun with it.</p>
<p>Remember this quiz from the webinar? Again, pardon the crass title, but it&#8217;s not what you think. This is from the College Humor quiz <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6971979/quiz-whose-boobs-are-these">&#8220;Whose cleavage is this?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t recognize him, this is Dog the Bounty Hunter. While I&#8217;m not sure if I would classify his cleavage as &#8220;cool,&#8221; you get the point. This quiz is engaging because it&#8217;s out of the ordinary and combats the overarching assumption.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another one, since we&#8217;re on the bounty hunter theme (no, I&#8217;m not going to make any references to the <del>hit</del> <a href="https://youtu.be/e4N220XLowE" target="_blank">90s bounty hunter-themed TV show Renegade</a>). When Sideshow Collectibles made this quiz: <a href="https://www.sideshowtoy.com/blog/quiz-which-star-wars-bounty-hunter-are-you" target="_blank">&#8220;Which Star Wars bounty hunter are you?&#8221;</a>, they could&#8217;ve asked simple, straightforward questions. But they saw the magic of a quiz, and created questions like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png"><img class="  wp-image-1672 alignleft" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png" alt="scum" width="459" height="275" /></a></p>
<p>A quiz is not a real assessment. You aren&#8217;t confined by the bounds of scientific thought and limits, so again—have some fun with it.</p>
<h4>Help me feel sufficiently assessed</h4>
<p>I know I just said quizzes aren&#8217;t real assessments, but I wasn&#8217;t completely serious. They need to retain some degree of legitimacy for people to invest in the result. If your quiz is three questions long, but then you try and offer me insights about who I am, it&#8217;s not going to seem legitimate to me and I&#8217;ll be significantly less likely to share my results.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1673" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png" alt="how many questions" width="1024" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>The quiz on the left isn&#8217;t likely to make me feel confident in the result I get. &#8220;Oh, I should buy a Lexus? You asked me three questions, I don&#8217;t think you know me well enough to make that kind of call.&#8221; However, in the quiz on the right, there are 10 questions to ascertain my personality, preferences, and character. So the fact that I get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_302_Mustang" target="_blank">Boss 302</a> makes me want to brag about it to my friends.</p>
<h4>Want more?</h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a> and Qzzr got together to talk about quizzes, content marketing, and going viral—and how to use tools from them to do all three. Our one-hour webinar (embedded below) gave a lot of great tips and hints, but the crème de la crème had to be the six steps to creating a sweet quiz from our Chief Qwizard Owen and BuzzSumo’s Stephen Walsh.</p>
<h5><a href="http://ctt.ec/2NAdM" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Click to Tweet your thanks to Stephen!</a></h5>
<p>So we thought, why not turn those steps into a step-by-step list in a blog post so you can refer to it again and again when you make a quiz? Let us give you the meat and potatoes—and if we leave you wanting more, our webinar’s always there for a listen.</p>
<p><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1599" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Why-quizzes--300x150.png" alt="Why quizzes- 6 steps to a sweet quiz" width="484" height="242" /></p>
<p>First questions first: why are quizzes the new golden child of content marketing? Sure, they’re a form of media. But why are they more popular than, say, infographics or surveys or a plain old blog post? It’s because quizzes are engaging and nourishing. We can interact with them and—lo and behold!—they interact back. They feed us by telling us things about ourselves. As humans, we are our own favorite subjects.</p>
<p>So to all the brands, marketers, and publishers out there: make us feel good about ourselves, make us laugh, and give us something to brag about. And when you do, we’ll interact like crazy—to the tune of 82% conversion rates.</p>
<h3><strong>The 6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Do your research</h4>
<p>The best quizzes come from content that gets shares—content that resonates with its readers, spawns controversy and questions, or is easily misunderstood. So making a great quiz comes from understanding the content. Look at your old content with a fresh eye. Lists, infographics, posts with lots of comments—why can’t they be turned into quizzes?</p>
<p>This is also where BuzzSumo comes in. <a href="http://buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">Using their tool</a>, you can search topics and websites (even adding “quiz” or “?” after the terms to limit your results to quizzes) and see what’s being shared across the internet. Stephen made a great point during the webinar that recycling content for quizzes from checklists or how-to’s is incredibly easy. Get an idea of what’s out there—and how you make it even better.</p>
<h4>2. Choose your quiz</h4>
<p>There are two types of quizzes: graded and outcome. Your graded quizzes have titles like “How well do you know ___“ or “Are you a ___ expert?” and outcome quizzes are more along the lines of “Which superhero are you?” and “What color is your personality?”</p>
<p>Graded quizzes are about making people feel good about their score and educating as you go along. Assign outcomes like “You got 90%! You’re a genius!!” rather than simply “You got 90%”, and use the feedback option in Qzzr when you’re creating a quiz to throw in more interesting facts.</p>
<p>Outcome quizzes, on the other hand, need shareworthy resolutions. They should be designed with results that make people feel good and look good by helping people define themselves, invoking awe or laughter, or helping people share how they want to look to their friends.</p>
<p>Something surprisingly often overlooked in quiz creation is the importance of the title. It’s the first thing your potential quiz taker will see—so make it good. Good content always needs to have a hook, and that hook for a quiz is the title. BuzzSumo can help by showing you the most popular quizzes (hint: a lot of them have “hardest” or “ultimate” in the title).</p>
<p>We’re big on interactive content here at Qzzr, so we want to ask you: do graded quizzes or outcome quizzes sound more appealing to you? Take the poll (made with our sister tool <a href="http://www.pollcaster.com">Pollcaster</a>) and see what other people chose.</p>
<p><iframe id="mv-widget-KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" src="https://api.movementventures.com/widget/poll/KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" width="500px" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h4>3. Strategize your call to action</h4>
<p>People use quizzes in content marketing for lots of reasons. So what’s yours? Are you trying to generate leads? Make a sale? Gain more newsletter subscribers? Get more traffic? Defining your reason for wanting a quiz determines the call-to-action, which in turn helps you design your quiz.</p>
<p>First, understand the persona of your audience. Use BuzzSumo to look into the space you’re targeting and find topic ideas. Always focus on what your audience cares about or what both you and your audience care about jointly—otherwise you lose them.</p>
<p>Next, define the outcomes of your quiz. Make it something that people are proud to share. And make sure your call to action, whether that’s putting in an email address or linking to another blog post, is related to that outcome.</p>
<h4>4. Make your quiz</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have a secret recipe for the perfect quiz (don’t worry—we’re working on it). But in the meantime, here are some guidelines for you to follow in your search for virality:</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something cool.</h5>
<p>Keep me engaged by asking me interesting questions (quality over quantity)</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something meaningful. And convince me it’s meaningful.</h5>
<p>Make me feel sufficiently assessed. I won’t believe that you really know who I am or who I should be if you’ve only asked me three questions.</p>
<h5>&gt; Feed me and give me something to brag about.</h5>
<p>Give me feedback. Tell me if I’m right or wrong and then give me something else interesting. And in the outcome, tell me more about myself.</p>
<h5>&gt; Make me laugh.</h5>
<p>This quiz is a perfect example of making people laugh. We usually suggest people make positive outcomes—this quiz went the opposite direction and made the outcomes hilariously offensive. It worked—it&#8217;s been taken over 200,000 times and people love sharing their [sometimes painful] results.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="22314"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h5>&gt; Make me an offer I can’t refuse.</h5>
<p>This ties back into the call-to-action. Basically, tell me who I am and then tell me why I want what you have to offer me, whether that’s another blog post to read, an offer or newsletter to sign up for, or a drawing to enter into.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1600" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Make-it...-300x150.png" alt="How do you make a sweet quiz? Use these tips" width="594" height="297" /></p>
<p>Make sure to use images. We’re visual beings and we want to be shown things. Equally important, images need to be licensed to be legal for commercial use. So if you’re a bit short on pictures, you can do a Google Image search and filter using Advanced Search to only find those labeled for reuse. For more info, see our post on <a title="Qzzr Answers: Images and Qzzr" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/images-qzzr/">Images and Qzzr</a>.</p>
<h5>5. Share your quiz</h5>
<p>Now that your quiz has been made, share it with the world! Put it on your blog and social media. BuzzSumo can also help you step up your game here too. Search your topic (or even rival quizzes on your topic) and click “View Sharers” for a certain piece of content. Find the influencers with high domain authority and retweet ratios who shared those pieces and ask if they’d be interested in sharing yours too.</p>
<h5>6. Learn, adapt, and improve it</h5>
<p>The best part of using Qzzr to make a quiz is the analytics that come with it. Test different quiz titles, questions, and outcomes to see what appeals to your target customer.</p>
<p>There you go—that’s the distillation of our webinar in partnership with BuzzSumo. Good luck going viral and merry quiz-making! We’ll leave you with a few last surprising facts we learned from Stephen and Owen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher sharing something is what it takes to make it viral.</li>
<li>The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
<li>The #1 NYTimes article in 2013 was a quiz. And in case that’s not recent enough for you, nine out of ten of the most shared stories on Facebook in January 2015 were quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more great tidbits you probably didn’t know (and to hear some of Owen’s terrible puns), listen to our webinar with BuzzSumo in its entirety.</p>

<p>We had an awesome webinar last week with Nicole Kroese from Likeable Local. Jokes were made, fun times were had, and a whole heap of helpful information was imparted. We learned that Owen would look great in a double-strap tankini and that Nicole is a dancer – but most of all, <strong>we learned how to make a quiz and intelligently promote it to double your social engagement and conversion</strong>. Yeah, heavy stuff.</p>
<h5>&gt;&gt;Want to make a quiz? <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/pricing/">Sign up for a free account</a> and work along with us!</h5>
<p>Feel free to watch the webinar, or check out the slides – <a title="[Webinar] Likeable Local + Qzzr: How to Create World Class Quizzes" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/webinar-world-class-quizzes/" target="_blank">both were posted immediately</a> after the webinar.</p>
<h3>Why make a quiz to promote your brand?</h3>
<p>Quizzes are at the forefront of a content renaissance. The internet is flooded with content, and most of it not very good. Your goal as a top shot marketer is to help yours cut through the fog and stand out.</p>
<p>Surveys, infographics, and lists are great and all, but quizzes hold more potential than many of today’s other popular content types. Luckily for you, we’re going to show you precisely why.</p>
<p>Aren’t quizzes just the same as surveys?</p>
<p>No – here’s why:</p>
<h4>Surveys come wrapped in desperation</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Please-Sir-Survey-small.jpeg" alt="survey vs quiz" width="550" height="733" /></p>
<p>While very similar in nature, quizzes capture people’s attention and draw them in – they can’t get enough! The proof is in the pudding: the New York Times’ most shared article in 2013 was a quiz, and nine of the ten most shared posts on Facebook in January 2015 were as well.</p>
<h4>So why are quizzes so irresistible?</h4>
<p>We think it’s because they’re so engaging and nourishing. We can’t wait to get a result and find out something interesting about ourselves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1578" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stop-telling-me-quote.jpg" alt="Stop telling me quote" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>Quizzes have an 81% completion rate – people stick with them. <strong>The questions <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/79684693-is-your-content-an-enthralling-conversation-or-an-awkward-goodbye" target="_blank">act like an interesting conversation</a>, which drives them to share little bits of themselves in order to learn more</strong>. What’s more is that 82% of people will take a quiz if they see it in their social feed. So you post a quiz – on average, 82% of the people that see it will start it, and 81% of those people will finish it.</p>
<p>Is that not impressive enough for you? The average quiz takes roughly two and a half minutes to complete (which does wonders for your SEO), and is shared over 1,900 times (which is pretty good, if we say so ourselves).</p>
<p><strong>All of this combines to make quizzes faster, cheaper, and more effective than almost any other type of content.</strong></p>
<p>Social media and content mavens have two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive traffic</li>
<li>Drive conversions</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of quizzes that have done that:</p>
<p>News site <a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=29674897" target="_blank">KSL.com created a quiz</a> to test people’s knowledge of the US Citizenship Test. It’s been been taken over 137,000 times (!) and the comment board got lit up.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="5235"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script>CarThrottle is an online automotive enthusiasts’ community. They posted a quiz, <a href="http://www.carthrottle.com/post/how-much-of-a-petrolhead-are-you-really-70-per-cent-means-youre-doing-well/" target="_blank">Are You a True Gearhead?</a>, and it’s been taken over 300,000 times – at the time of this writing, it had 473 comments. If that’s not traffic, I don’t know what is.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="676"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>Online optics company Zenni Optical <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank">launched a quiz to help people find the eyeglass style</a> that best represented them. Questions drew out information on color, lifestyle, and face shape to provide an accurate recommendation. It has worked – <strong>to the tune of <a title="The Anatomy of the Million Dollar Quiz [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/million-dollar-quiz-revenue/" target="_blank">nearly $1 million in revenue</a>, and climbing</strong>.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="7951"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script>So, how do I make a quiz?</p>
<h3>Research topics</h3>
<p>You can make a quiz, or you can make a great quiz. Studying great content can give you insights into what will perform well for you. Ask these questions to set yourself up for success from the get-go: What’s trending right now? What topics have been successful for you in the past? Have any of your competitors made quizzes before? Which topics have been most successful? Are there decisions that people struggle to make? We don’t get any kickbacks from <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">Buzzsumo</a> for saying this, but we’ve found their tool extremely helpful for research on buzzworthy topics. Try it out and see if it’s any good for you.</p>
<h3>Choose quiz title and type</h3>
<p>Your title is your quiz’s headline, so the same thought should go into it. You want to engage people – make them want to drill in and get a result. There are two quiz types: graded and outcome. Graded quizzes follow the traditional quiz archetype – they have right or wrong answers. The end result of a graded quiz is a percentage (You got ___% of the questions correct). An outcome quiz does not have right or wrong answers; it’s questions gather information to lead to – you guessed it – an outcome (You got “AC Slater” in the “Which Saved By The Bell character are you?” quiz). Here are a few quiz title examples given for each quiz type: <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Quiz-types.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Quiz-types.png" alt="Quiz types" width="560" height="315" /></a> If you’d like more information on what each quiz type offers, <a title="Graded or Outcome? Tap Into the Psychology of Quiz Types" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/graded-or-outcome-psychology-of-quiz-types/" target="_blank">we’ve written before with a bit more detail</a>.</p>
<h3>Do your research and gather media</h3>
<p>This is where you’ll strategize your quiz content. If you’re creating a graded quiz, you’ll need a lot of facts. If it’s an outcome quiz, be strategic and fun about how you ask for information. Example: In your “Which farm animal are you?” quiz, don’t ask “Which food sounds good?” and then show pictures of hay, corn, oats, etc. Come up with another way of getting responses that aren’t so obvious and boring. Images must be used in accordance with all copyrights and restrictions. Here’s a resource on <a title="Qzzr Answers: Images and Qzzr" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/images-qzzr/" target="_blank">finding images for quizzes</a>, and DesignRope has a great blog post with <a href="http://designrope.com/design/find-stock-photos-dont-suck/" target="_blank">14 places to find stock photos that don’t suck</a>.</p>
<h3>Create and embed</h3>
<p>If you have all of your stuff together, this is the easy part. <a href="http://www.qzzr.com" target="_blank">Use a platform like Qzzr</a> to make life easy on yourself, and you’ll be impressed with the imagery as well.</p>
<h3>Share and promote</h3>
<p>This was where Nicole and Likeable Local’s expertise really shines. Content used to promote itself – you could create a website and throw some words and pictures on it, and people would come to it. Not anymore. For one thing, the internet is now inundated with clutter. “Content” is everywhere, and it can be hard to cut through the fog to be seen by your prospects. In addition, things like “<a href="http://www.inc.com/dave-kerpen/facebook-reachageddon-is-coming-3-key-solutions-for-your-business.html" target="_blank">Facebook Reachageddon</a>” made us pay to play. It’s now necessary to open up the wallet to make sure your posts get seen. It’s not all doom n’ gloom, though. If you create high quality and relevant quizzes, and promote them well, they WILL pay off. Here’s where more research pays off: (Are you detecting a theme?) <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1585" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Where-are-prospects-hanging-out.png" alt="Where are prospects hanging out?" width="1277" height="426" /> Social media has a 100% higher lead-to-close rate than outbound marketing, so spend the bulk of your time there. Use these two ways to get your content in front of the right prospects:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Run awesome paid social ads</li>
<li>Create and expand your fan club</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h4> Run awesome paid ads</h4>
<p>Unless you want to waste your money, follow these bits of advice when creating ads:</p>
<p><strong>Set goals</strong> – But not the generic ones like “I’d like to be successful with this campaign.” Nah, you gotta set SMART goals. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SET-SMART-GOALS.png" alt="set smart goals" width="1024" height="512" /> Some of this is already built into the social ads platform. Do you want your ad to:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>send people to your website?</li>
<li>increase conversions on your website?</li>
<li>boost your posts?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1582" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ad-campaign-goals.png" alt="social media ad campaign goals" width="1330" height="675" /> <strong>Reach the right people</strong> – Here’s Likeable Local’s founder, Dave Kerpen, on reaching the right people:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
You know what&#8217;s cooler than reaching 1 billion people on Facebook? Reaching the perfect 1000. Or 100. or 10. — Dave Kerpen (@DaveKerpen) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveKerpen/status/313643603748614144">March 18, 2013</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>One way to do this is by creating smart audiences. Facebook allows you to build wide profiles of potential customers by adding particular demographic, interest, job title, or location filters. The robustness by which you can find the right people is really cool, actually.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/audiences.png" alt="audiences" width="643" height="466" /></p>
<p><strong>Scale smarter</strong> – Don’t run before you can walk. There’s no need to. Follow these three pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double down on what’s working</li>
<li>You may be sick of your ad, but your prospects aren’t</li>
<li>Adapt to current trends</li>
</ul>
<h4>Create and expand your fan club</h4>
<p>If what you’re bringing to the table is truly meaningful and you can get it in front of people effectively, you WILL attract potential customers. Make sure that when they come to you, you’re prepared to turn them into raving fans. Here’s how you can do that:</p>
<p><strong>Choose a strategic partner</strong> – A good partner means doubled promotion and visibility. Even more so if you find someone with a larger reach than you. Look for thought leaders in your industry, and complementary companies (those that don’t directly compete with you for customers, but that contribute different value).</p>
<p><strong>Make sharing easy and fun</strong> – All content should have a call to action, preferably to share. Cool new tools like Click to Tweets make it easy for readers to share a pre-designed tweet.</p>
<p><strong>Listen and respond</strong> – Track keywords, hashtags and mentions that affect your industry or brand, and respond to everyone, because…</p>
<p><strong>Social media is the new word of mouth</strong> – 90% of people trust business recommendations from someone they know, and people are 4X more likely to buy when referred by a friend. If this is true, then you know the inverse is true as well – so make sure you promptly address negative comments as well.</p>
<p>Social ads, shared posts, and popular content have built in endorsements from friends – potential customers will see reference to friends who have liked your page or content you’ve shared.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Quizzes hold immense power to engage and convert your potential customers, but like any other content, they’re only effective if people see them. Luckily, there are experts like Owen and Nicole, who love sharing the tips and tricks that have made them and their companies successful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve followed our blog for long, you’ve certainly heard about the Zenni Optical quiz that has blown up, producing incredible results. We’ve been riding the roller coaster with them, and we wanted to grab an opportunity to step back and analyze how it all happened.</p>
<p>Today we had <a href="https://vimeo.com/126620525" target="_blank">a great webinar with Becca James from Internet Marketing Inc</a> (IMI)—the agency behind the quiz—who took us through the quiz execution process, allowing us to reverse engineer the magic of a [nearly] million dollar quiz.</p>
<p><em>Edit (5/14/15): This quiz has now generated $1,020,660!</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ctt.ec/V35uO" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Click to Tweet your gratitude to Becca</a></strong></p>
<h3>The anatomy of the [nearly] million dollar quiz</h3>
<p>First things first, here’s the quiz we’re referring to:</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="7951"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>So how did this thing take off and generate nearly $1 million?</h4>
<h3>1. Goals</h3>
<p>As with any campaign, to reach amazing results, you need to start with goals. From a broader perspective, the four things that Zenni Optical wanted most out of their partnership with IMI were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase organic traffic</li>
<li>Improve search ranking</li>
<li>Increased brand awareness</li>
<li>Quality link building</li>
</ol>
<p>For this particular campaign, Zenni had developed a “<a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/trendy-eyeglasses" target="_blank">Hottest Trends</a>” landing page with eight frame styles on it, and they wanted IMI to help drive traffic to it. So, that’s where they started.</p>
<h3>2. Strategy</h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Strategy.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1550" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Strategy.jpg" alt="Zenni Strategy" width="997" height="527" /></a></h4>
<h4>Research and data</h4>
<p>Becca pointed out how important it is for them at IMI to build a foundation of data and insights before they move on to the creation process. What does this mean?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical research</span> — This included keyword research, an understanding of SEO practices and how this landing page was doing. It also included housekeeping items to make sure that the page was crawlable by Google.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conversational research</span> — It was important to not only know what keywords were at play, but what their consumers were saying. What were they looking for? What questions did they have? To achieve this, IMI plugged the keywords into a social listening tool, to provide audience insights. The one they use is NetBase, but there are many out there. What’s important is that you use one.</p>
<p>This is important because it tells you <strong>how people are talking about those keywords—</strong>it’s really valuable to know, because you’re studying how you can be a solution. Remember, the goal in content marketing is to provide meaningful information, and you can only do this if you know what meaning is to them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comparative research</span> — Ask these questions: What is your competitive landscape? What are you going up against? Where are consumers turning to right now to get their answers?</p>
<h4>Define target audience</h4>
<p>We touch on this in every insight, but it’s imperative to know your audience. And the best way to do this is by developing personas. To do this, you’ll compile your audience insights, demographic data and what you know about the brand to differentiate the key types of people that will end up being your customers. <strong>Developing personas is the number one rule of creating quizzes</strong>.</p>
<h4>Match personas to the outputs of the quiz</h4>
<p>Here’s why this is amazing—<strong>if you’re building a quiz, you want nothing more than for the people taking the quiz to get their result and say “Wow, that’s amazing.”</strong> You want the answer to ring so true that an instant rapport is built. BOOM—you have understanding and legitimacy.</p>
<p>There’s this magical self-identifying element to a really good quiz, or piece of interactive content. The customer experience goes from just finding a solution online to feeling like a personalized solution was created for them.</p>
<p>And that magic is manifested through two priceless results—brand affinity and organically driven conversion. Simply put—<strong>people love brands that make their lives better, and they’re willing to listen to them</strong>.</p>
<p>And there are the two greatest things you can offer in content marketing: (1) personalization and (2) a solution. A well crafted quiz offers both.</p>
<h4>Call to action</h4>
<p>After you’ve provided this for people, give them something to do about it. And make it as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>A note on design from IMI: If your quiz and landing page are synonymous in design and messaging, people will easily think that the landing page is still part of the quiz or that it’s personalized for them. <strong>Therefore, they feel like they’re engaging in a really special experience.</strong></p>
<h3>3. Promotion</h3>
<p>There is a massive clutter of content on the internet. The only definitive way that your content will be successful is an investment in promotion.</p>
<p>What’s the perfect mix of promotion? Becca broke their promotion strategy down into three categories:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Owned</span> — The quiz was promoted through any channel they had direct access to—these efforts included newsletters, banners on the homepage, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Earned</span> — Included in this category were social media channels and outreach to key influencers in their network. Some of these were fashion experts and outlets, as well as optometry publications and thought leaders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paid</span> — Content marketing is supposed to be primarily organic, but it’s important that, among the owned and earned, you use a mix of paid search, paid social and content amplification strategies. They paid for ads on Facebook, but they also used services like StumbleUpon, Outbrain, IZEA, and Taboola to push the quiz out and <strong>target it to specific audiences that would care about it</strong>.</p>
<h3>4. Results/Tracking</h3>
<p>In content marketing, it’s important to define success, and how you define success. What factors will determine that you’ve been successful? To gauge results well, you want a metric that you can track at every step down the conversion funnel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Results-Pipeline.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1549" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Results-Pipeline.jpg" alt="Zenni Results Pipeline" width="1037" height="502" /></a></p>
<h4>Visibility</h4>
<p>How many people saw your content? You’ll want to track page views, email opens, inbound links, and referral visitors.</p>
<h4>Engagement</h4>
<p>Engagement from content marketing is not as clear as that from PPC—you can’t just point to how much money you put in and how much money you got out.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s not to say that you can’t track your engagement. But you may need to be a little more creative about how you do it. What Becca decided to track was on on-page engagement and off-page engagement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-page engagement or quiz engagement</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How many people take the quiz?</li>
<li>How many finished the quiz?</li>
<li>How many lead conversions did they get? Emails? Click-throughs?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-01-at-5.12.13-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1548" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-01-at-5.12.13-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-01 at 5.12.13 PM" width="955" height="447" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-page engagement</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Was it liked?</li>
<li>Was it shared?</li>
<li>Did people leave positive comments?</li>
<li>Where does it rank on search engines?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Traffic and lead quality</h4>
<p>Behavior funnels are a great way to feel this out, because they illustrate the customer journey and speaks to the quality of the content. Using tools like Google Analytics, you can see what people do after they take the quiz. Do they continue on through your CTA like you ask them to? Or do they go somewhere else? Do they then continue on to conversion?</p>
<p>When we launched this webinar, we called it the Half Million Dollar Quiz. But since then, we realized that the new number is $909,738.06, with 533,538 unique visitors. That’s just under $1 million in revenue, and a 7,500% return on investment. Wow! That’s just incredible.</p>
<p>Another thing you’ll want to pinpoint is which channels were the most revenue-generating. For IMI, these were the top three sources of revenue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organic search: $104,924.34</li>
<li>Paid search: $73,393.06</li>
<li>Email: $73, 331.96</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Remember, content marketing is a long-tail form of marketing. If you do it right, your content will live for a long time, continually bringing in new business—this quiz is every bit as profitable now as it was when it was released. And by that I mean it&#8217;s <em>really </em>profitable.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled with how this quiz has turned out. In the end, the agency and brand (IMI and Zenni) win, the platform (Qzzr) wins, and the customers win—they had a really great experience that ultimately resulted in many of them purchasing products that they were very happy with.</p>
<p>And the relationship with the customer continues—you have their email addresses, but you also have a lot of valuable information about them that will allow you to continue to provide meaningful information and recommendations to your customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, what a great day. Earlier this afternoon, we hosted a webinar with an unbeatable duo – Guy Kawasaki and Peg Fitzpatrick. The two engagement moguls are co-authors of a book called The Art of Social Media, and joined us to share their social media strategy template.</p>
<h5><a title="Entrepreneur Quiz: Are You an Art of the Start Expert?" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/entrepreneur-quiz-art-of-the-start/" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Take Guy&#8217;s Art of the Start quiz</a></h5>
<p>If you’d like to check out the full video of today’s webinar, you can find it along with the slide deck at the bottom of this post. We’ll jump right into these 12 tips, but one quick anecdote is worth sharing :</p>
<p>At the outset of the webinar, before we dove into their tips, we threw in a quick plug for <a href="http://go.qzzr.com/half-million" target="_blank">another webinar we’re hosting tomorrow with Internet Marketing Inc</a>. These guys recently launched a quiz for Zenni Optical, and among other feats, the quiz has generated nearly $500,000 at the time of this writing.</p>
<p><em>Update 5/27/15: This quiz has now generated over $1 million. Incredible!</em></p>
<p>When we mentioned this in the webinar, Guy interrupted to say “How does a quiz generate half a million dollars in revenue? I want to understand that. Maybe I’ll give up social media and switch to quizzing. How does that work?”</p>
<p>So when you have one of the world’s foremost experts on business and social media, and he’s taken aback by the return on investment from one isolated campaign, there’s definitely major value to that. Click below to check out that webinar:</p>
<p><a href="http://go.qzzr.com/half-million/" target="_blank"><img class="  wp-image-1528 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-30-at-4.36.51-PM.png" alt="Join us to discuss quiz marketing strategy, and how one quiz generated nearly half a million dollars in revenue." width="808" height="295" /></a></p>
<h3>The Art of Social Media: a social media strategy template</h3>
<p>Guy and Peg laid out what could be the 12 best insights in today’s fast-paced, competitive social media landscape. The value held in these tips, if applied immediately, holds untold value for you and your brand.</p>
<h3>Think Tinder, not eHarmony</h3>
<p>When crafting your social media strategy, remember what environment you’re in. If we’re comparing social media to a dating service, it’s Tinder, not eHarmony.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eHarmony-vs-Tinder.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1539" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eHarmony-vs-Tinder.jpg" alt="eHarmony vs Tinder" width="632" height="542" /></a></p>
<p>eHarmony asks a thousand questions to really try and get to know you and the aspects about you that may or may not be compatible with potential matches.</p>
<p>Tinder, however, shows you a picture, and asks you to determine instantly whether you think that person is “Hot or not.” Swipe left to pass, or right to match and learn more. There’s not much more to it than that.</p>
<p>In your social media, remember that people are going to make an instant decision about whether they like what you’re providing or not. In one moment, they’ll swipe left to ignore and not follow, or swipe right to follow you, learn more, and interact further.</p>
<p>What does this mean? One, you need to make things as simple as possible. Don’t post an essay, post a quick snippet. Two, post something that is visually appealing, and that conveys quickly what you or your brand is about.</p>
<p>Start first with your avatar and cover photos. Both should convey three important things about you – that you’re likeable, trustworthy, and competent.</p>
<p>Avatars should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be a picture of your face</li>
<li>not be cropped – don’t take your face from a crowd</li>
<li>be asymmetric</li>
<li>be front-lit – you want them to be able to clearly see you</li>
</ul>
<p>For a brand, use your logo. Anything else doesn’t look quite as professional.</p>
<p>Cover photos should:</p>
<ul>
<li>tell a story that you want conveyed</li>
<li>use darker colors</li>
<li>be hi-res and optimized for the proper size</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add images to every post</h3>
<p>Every post that you throw out on social media should include an image. The only exceptions should be when you are responding to someone else’s post.</p>
<p>People are programmed to pick up visual cues before text. Your goal on social media – just like in every other endeavor – should be to stand out from the crowd. Take a look at the Twitter feed below. Where are your eyes naturally drawn?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/twitter-images.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1532" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/twitter-images.jpg" alt="twitter images" width="375" height="498" /></a></p>
<p>To the image, right? Regardless of how long the other people spent crafting the words and syntax of their posts, it’s the one with the image that stands out, and you can bet it’s the one most likely to get engagement.</p>
<p>Fun tip: Did you know you can share up to four images in a Tweet?</p>
<h3>Repeat your posts</h3>
<p>It goes against our gut instinct sometimes, but the best social media wizards know how powerful repeat posting can be.</p>
<p>It makes sense – not everyone is on social media at the same time. Night Owls are unlikely to catch a post or tweet that landed that morning, and vice versa for the Early Birds. Post your best content multiple times throughout the day to capture the must engagement.</p>
<p>Now, it’s something that you want to experiment on with your own account, but Guy shared that his sweet spot happens to be right at about eight hours. He’ll get almost the same engagement the second and third times he posts the same content as he does the first – sometimes even more! To him (and really to anyone) it’s a no-brainer. If he can post it once and get 1,200 likes, or three times and get 3,600, why wouldn’t he?</p>

<p>Now, you’re occasionally going to get some people that notice this and feel the need to call you out on it. Do not let that deter you. If you have to lose a couple of followers to gain another 100, it’s well worth it.</p>
<h3>Ensure Pin-ability</h3>
<p>Pinterest has become an incredible way to interact with and engage new people. In fact, in many ways, Pinterest is becoming the new Google. People flock to it not only to find new shoes, but to search for information. Make it easy for them to find you, and to share your content with the world.</p>
<p>One quick example of this is in images. Make sure that the content you are sharing has a compelling image that is easy to share. If you’re posting a blog post or page from your website, make sure that you set a featured image.</p>
<p>That will help ensure that people don’t end up sharing this type of image:</p>

<h3>Experiment constantly</h3>
<p>Social media changes every day, as does the way that people interact with it. So it’s 100 percent imperative that you test regularly to make sure that you’re adapting with it, and squeezing every bit of value out of it.</p>
<h3>Target with Facebook</h3>
<p>Use targeting features to deliver your content to the people that want it most. Do some research into your existing customers and Facebook fans – are they predominantly male or female? Do they live in the US or abroad? How old are they?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Target-Facebook.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1535" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Target-Facebook.jpg" alt="Target Facebook" width="749" height="459" /></a></p>
<p>Use any factors you can to determine who likes your stuff, and then target your outreach at more people like that. Offer valuable content to bring them in and convert.</p>
<h3>Go artisanal</h3>
<p>Did you know that you can get better Facebook reach by posting directly within Facebook, rather than scheduling and posting through another app? In many cases, it’s staggering how much of a difference it makes. Facebook now offers robust scheduling options, which makes it a lot easier to go directly with them.</p>
<h3>Order your Instagram filters</h3>
<p>This is a fun tip – did you know that you can rearrange your favorite Instagram filters by holding them down and dragging? This lets you put the ones you use most in the four prime real estate spots, saving time.</p>
<h3>Upload video to Facebook and embed everywhere</h3>
<p>Facebook has really been pushing the video thing lately. In fact, they’ve built a lot of their newsfeed algorithms to heavily favor native Facebook video over other video giants like YouTube and Vimeo.</p>
<p>In other words, if you upload video directly to Facebook, it’s likely to be seen twice as often as if you upload to YouTube and post the link in Facebook. Below you’ll see two examples of this. In the first picture, the video was uploaded to Facebook, and in the second, you’ll see a YouTube link.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Facebook-video-upload.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1536" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Facebook-video-upload.jpg" alt="Facebook video upload" width="712" height="554" /></a></p>
<p>If you can’t see, the first was seen over 30,000 times, while the second had only 13,000 views.</p>
<p>Both were posted within five minutes of each other. This is important to note for two reasons. One, it shows that the conditions were almost identical. He didn’t post one on a Sunday night and the other at noon on Tuesday. Two, it testifies once more to the power of repeat posting. Not one person complained that it was posted twice, and another 13,000 people saw the post as a result.</p>
