				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a stellar week. On Wednesday, <a title="Pollcaster: Qzzr’s New Brother Provides Immersive Poll Experience" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/pollcaster-qzzr-new-poll-tool/">we unveiled Pollcaster to the world</a>. Yesterday, we did a quick webinar to share the magic of polls with the world. Today, we wanted to pump out some of that magic into a few quick tidbits to get you started.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pollcaster-webinar-tile.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1486 size-medium" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pollcaster-webinar-tile-300x300.png" alt="Pollcaster webinar tile" width="300" height="300" /></a></h4>
<h4>Why Polls?</h4>
<p>Polls are all about taking your opinion, and comparing it to that of a larger body. The problem with every other tool for us was that it left us with a void—almost like we had more questions than when we started.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Who are these people that I’m compared to? How old are they? Do people in New York think the same way I do? What about Europe? Is it a gender thing</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Pollcaster is a conversation primer.</strong> It represents a way to dive into this information and interact with it by seeing exactly how the numbers break down by gender, region, and age.</p>
<p>Qzzr champions the same thinking—if you can engage people on an emotional level (more than just capturing their eyes or brains), they’re much more likely to interact with your content. This means sharing, signing up for your list, entering your contest, downloading an infographic or whatever your call to action might be.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=1288&amp;sid=34260832" target="_blank">take this poll by local news site KSL</a>. This was one of the first posted after we launched on Wednesday, and it’s been taken over 3,000 times. But what’s most interesting isn’t that, <strong>but how many people have taken to the comments to further state and defend their own opinion</strong> or start discussions on insights gleaned from the information.<strong> </strong>And isn&#8217;t that what social media was designed to do?</p>
<div class="mv-widget" data-widget="poll" data-id="ROV5vYUjpi0QBv3ewMZrmLvk9ac" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></div>
<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>Now that’s cool as the person taking the poll, but imagine how much cooler that is as the poll architect. You have incredible amounts of data streaming into your coffers, plus all of the social traffic as people share the love with friends and family, asking them to throw their take into the mix.</p>
<h4>Why Interactive Content?</h4>
<p>Here’s the thing. The amount of content on the internet right now is smothering. Think “bad dream of you trying to claw your way out of a mountain of teddy bears” smothering (maybe that’s just me). But in order to cut through that, your content has to be memorable. And there’s no better way to be memorable than to tap into the user’s own emotions or understanding of themselves.</p>
<p>For more detail on this thinking, watch the webinar below. If you have questions or insights, put them in the comments below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">we release Pollcaster</a>.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it’s been a year since we launched Qzzr. Since then, we’ve seen hundreds of millions of questions answered on thousands of quizzes created by some of the top publishers and brands in the world. We’ve been involved in just about every major cultural phenomenon from <a href="http://gawker.com/what-color-is-this-goddamn-dress-1688330170" target="_blank">#dressgate</a> to <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6995741/quiz-skin-or-leggings" target="_blank">leggings</a>, and seen a grip of savvy businesses use quizzes to boost revenue, engagement, and web traffic—<a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank">[one quiz in particular has netted almost half a million in revenue (!)]</a>. We could say things have gone well, but it would be like <a href="https://youtu.be/oqq-glymrRs" target="_blank">calling the knuckle-puck moderately effective</a>.</p>
<p>One question keeps popping up: “Why don’t you guys do polls? If you made a poll tool with the same magic as Qzzr, I would use it every day.” Well, that day is here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Pollcaster</a> is like no other. Our CEO Josh Little was adamant that it contain all the same “secret-saucomeness” that Qzzr does, employing impeccable visuals and engaging stats to make every poll as insanely shareable as our quizzes. And boy, does it deliver.</p>
<div class="mv-widget" data-widget="poll" data-id="1pVE992iXJ8CkscH5q5dQOHHSxN" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></div>
<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script>At face value, the poll is already impressive, and stands apart from other poll tools on the market. But add to that an ability to see a breakdown of results by region, age, and gender—insights that let your audience step into the results to see where they fit in. <img class=" size-full wp-image-1478 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jalopnik-poll.png" alt="jalopnik poll" width="655" height="326" /> The magic of these polls is in the breakdown, which will transport you into a world of compelling graphics, where you can dive in and explore the data yourself. <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/breakdown.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1479 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/breakdown.png" alt="breakdown" width="924" height="325" /></a> Try one out—here’s one that our friends over at Jalopnik recently posted. </p>

<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Go create your first poll right now</a>. It’s completely free and super easy. You can even log in with your Qzzr account.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, sign up for a webinar we’re hosting tomorrow (Thursday, April 16, 2015): <a href="http://go.pollcaster.com/pollcaster-webinar/" target="_blank">How to Make the Most Engaging Polls on the Planet</a>. In it, our CEO and Chief Evangelist will discuss:</p>
