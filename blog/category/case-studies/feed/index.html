				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve followed our blog for long, you’ve certainly heard about the Zenni Optical quiz that has blown up, producing incredible results. We’ve been riding the roller coaster with them, and we wanted to grab an opportunity to step back and analyze how it all happened.</p>
<p>Today we had <a href="https://vimeo.com/126620525" target="_blank">a great webinar with Becca James from Internet Marketing Inc</a> (IMI)—the agency behind the quiz—who took us through the quiz execution process, allowing us to reverse engineer the magic of a [nearly] million dollar quiz.</p>
<p><em>Edit (5/14/15): This quiz has now generated $1,020,660!</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ctt.ec/V35uO" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Click to Tweet your gratitude to Becca</a></strong></p>
<h3>The anatomy of the [nearly] million dollar quiz</h3>
<p>First things first, here’s the quiz we’re referring to:</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="7951"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>So how did this thing take off and generate nearly $1 million?</h4>
<h3>1. Goals</h3>
<p>As with any campaign, to reach amazing results, you need to start with goals. From a broader perspective, the four things that Zenni Optical wanted most out of their partnership with IMI were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase organic traffic</li>
<li>Improve search ranking</li>
<li>Increased brand awareness</li>
<li>Quality link building</li>
</ol>
<p>For this particular campaign, Zenni had developed a “<a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/trendy-eyeglasses" target="_blank">Hottest Trends</a>” landing page with eight frame styles on it, and they wanted IMI to help drive traffic to it. So, that’s where they started.</p>
<h3>2. Strategy</h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Strategy.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1550" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Strategy.jpg" alt="Zenni Strategy" width="997" height="527" /></a></h4>
<h4>Research and data</h4>
<p>Becca pointed out how important it is for them at IMI to build a foundation of data and insights before they move on to the creation process. What does this mean?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical research</span> — This included keyword research, an understanding of SEO practices and how this landing page was doing. It also included housekeeping items to make sure that the page was crawlable by Google.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conversational research</span> — It was important to not only know what keywords were at play, but what their consumers were saying. What were they looking for? What questions did they have? To achieve this, IMI plugged the keywords into a social listening tool, to provide audience insights. The one they use is NetBase, but there are many out there. What’s important is that you use one.</p>
<p>This is important because it tells you <strong>how people are talking about those keywords—</strong>it’s really valuable to know, because you’re studying how you can be a solution. Remember, the goal in content marketing is to provide meaningful information, and you can only do this if you know what meaning is to them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comparative research</span> — Ask these questions: What is your competitive landscape? What are you going up against? Where are consumers turning to right now to get their answers?</p>
<h4>Define target audience</h4>
<p>We touch on this in every insight, but it’s imperative to know your audience. And the best way to do this is by developing personas. To do this, you’ll compile your audience insights, demographic data and what you know about the brand to differentiate the key types of people that will end up being your customers. <strong>Developing personas is the number one rule of creating quizzes</strong>.</p>
<h4>Match personas to the outputs of the quiz</h4>
<p>Here’s why this is amazing—<strong>if you’re building a quiz, you want nothing more than for the people taking the quiz to get their result and say “Wow, that’s amazing.”</strong> You want the answer to ring so true that an instant rapport is built. BOOM—you have understanding and legitimacy.</p>
<p>There’s this magical self-identifying element to a really good quiz, or piece of interactive content. The customer experience goes from just finding a solution online to feeling like a personalized solution was created for them.</p>
<p>And that magic is manifested through two priceless results—brand affinity and organically driven conversion. Simply put—<strong>people love brands that make their lives better, and they’re willing to listen to them</strong>.</p>
<p>And there are the two greatest things you can offer in content marketing: (1) personalization and (2) a solution. A well crafted quiz offers both.</p>
<h4>Call to action</h4>
<p>After you’ve provided this for people, give them something to do about it. And make it as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>A note on design from IMI: If your quiz and landing page are synonymous in design and messaging, people will easily think that the landing page is still part of the quiz or that it’s personalized for them. <strong>Therefore, they feel like they’re engaging in a really special experience.</strong></p>
<h3>3. Promotion</h3>
<p>There is a massive clutter of content on the internet. The only definitive way that your content will be successful is an investment in promotion.</p>
<p>What’s the perfect mix of promotion? Becca broke their promotion strategy down into three categories:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Owned</span> — The quiz was promoted through any channel they had direct access to—these efforts included newsletters, banners on the homepage, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Earned</span> — Included in this category were social media channels and outreach to key influencers in their network. Some of these were fashion experts and outlets, as well as optometry publications and thought leaders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paid</span> — Content marketing is supposed to be primarily organic, but it’s important that, among the owned and earned, you use a mix of paid search, paid social and content amplification strategies. They paid for ads on Facebook, but they also used services like StumbleUpon, Outbrain, IZEA, and Taboola to push the quiz out and <strong>target it to specific audiences that would care about it</strong>.</p>
<h3>4. Results/Tracking</h3>
<p>In content marketing, it’s important to define success, and how you define success. What factors will determine that you’ve been successful? To gauge results well, you want a metric that you can track at every step down the conversion funnel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Results-Pipeline.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1549" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zenni-Results-Pipeline.jpg" alt="Zenni Results Pipeline" width="1037" height="502" /></a></p>
<h4>Visibility</h4>
<p>How many people saw your content? You’ll want to track page views, email opens, inbound links, and referral visitors.</p>
<h4>Engagement</h4>
<p>Engagement from content marketing is not as clear as that from PPC—you can’t just point to how much money you put in and how much money you got out.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s not to say that you can’t track your engagement. But you may need to be a little more creative about how you do it. What Becca decided to track was on on-page engagement and off-page engagement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-page engagement or quiz engagement</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How many people take the quiz?</li>
<li>How many finished the quiz?</li>
<li>How many lead conversions did they get? Emails? Click-throughs?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-01-at-5.12.13-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1548" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-01-at-5.12.13-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-01 at 5.12.13 PM" width="955" height="447" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-page engagement</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Was it liked?</li>
<li>Was it shared?</li>
<li>Did people leave positive comments?</li>
<li>Where does it rank on search engines?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Traffic and lead quality</h4>
<p>Behavior funnels are a great way to feel this out, because they illustrate the customer journey and speaks to the quality of the content. Using tools like Google Analytics, you can see what people do after they take the quiz. Do they continue on through your CTA like you ask them to? Or do they go somewhere else? Do they then continue on to conversion?</p>
<p>When we launched this webinar, we called it the Half Million Dollar Quiz. But since then, we realized that the new number is $909,738.06, with 533,538 unique visitors. That’s just under $1 million in revenue, and a 7,500% return on investment. Wow! That’s just incredible.</p>
<p>Another thing you’ll want to pinpoint is which channels were the most revenue-generating. For IMI, these were the top three sources of revenue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organic search: $104,924.34</li>
<li>Paid search: $73,393.06</li>
<li>Email: $73, 331.96</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Remember, content marketing is a long-tail form of marketing. If you do it right, your content will live for a long time, continually bringing in new business—this quiz is every bit as profitable now as it was when it was released. And by that I mean it&#8217;s <em>really </em>profitable.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled with how this quiz has turned out. In the end, the agency and brand (IMI and Zenni) win, the platform (Qzzr) wins, and the customers win—they had a really great experience that ultimately resulted in many of them purchasing products that they were very happy with.</p>
<p>And the relationship with the customer continues—you have their email addresses, but you also have a lot of valuable information about them that will allow you to continue to provide meaningful information and recommendations to your customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s make a wager. I bet you a <a href="https://twitter.com/QzzrCowboy">Qzzr Cowboy $2 bill</a> that you can’t scroll down your social feed without being asked to enter a giveaway.</p>
<p>We all love to win free stuff, right? With few exceptions, we’ll happily go to some pretty crazy lengths for a chance at something we don’t necessarily need.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Oprah-Prize.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1475 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Oprah-Prize.jpg" alt="Oprah Prize" width="625" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>Businesses often turn to giveaways to increase social engagement, gain email subscribers, perform market research, or just improve brand perception.</p>
<p>Putting on a giveaway ain’t all fun and games, though, right? As <a href="http://www.inc.com/jim-belosic/social-media-giveaways-are-your-assumptions-preventing-success.html" target="_blank">this Inc. article points out</a>, there are several hurdles to overcome when designing one. As someone who has a few under my belt, my key takeaways from the article were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit barriers to entry</li>
<li>Make entry steps clear and simple
<ul>
<li>Design as if your entrants were drunk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put in the promo work
<ul>
<li>Don’t leave it to chance</li>
<li>Make it easy and desirable to share results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make it worth it—follow up</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="How Are E-commerce Brands Using Quizzes to Drive 60% Conversion?" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/ecommerce-brands-using-quizzes-to-drive-conversion/" target="_blank">As we’ve discussed before</a>, quizzes are a perfect way to gather leads and customer data. Whereas you once used giveaways to bribe people into sharing information via a survey, quizzes allow you to ask for the same information, but in a fun, engaging, and immersive way. Pair a giveaway with that quiz and you won’t have a bucket big enough to hold all of the data hurled at you.</p>
<h3>How to Create a Giveaway Quiz</h3>
<p>Keep in mind what we learned from the Inc. article: when designing a quiz aimed at generating contest entries, you want to make things as simple—yet engaging—as possible. Ask fun questions to draw people in and make responding a breeze. We recommend using images instead of text whenever possible, as it decreases eyestrain and conveys so much more than words can (1,000X, if I recall).</p>
<p>At the end of a quiz, when you do ask for entry info—again, keep things as simple as possible—ideally one field for an email address. The best quiz creators think of creative ways to incorporate information gathering into their quiz instead of tacking it on the end. An example might be “Look out the window; what picture most resembles where you live?” followed by beautiful images of a beach, snowy mountain, lush thick forest, or open plains. The responses to this question may allow you to send personalized clothing recommendations or seasonal home improvement tips, and it sure beats requiring a field titled “City” and “State.” You can bet that the people entering your giveaway will prefer it.</p>
<h3>How to Promote a Giveaway Quiz</h3>
<p>The way you structure your results will go a long way towards how likely someone will be to share what they got, and thus promote your contest. Spend some time thinking about how you word your results. As with any quiz, the person is much more likely to share if they’re proud of the way they performed. Give them a solid pat on the back and they’ll put the word out, even if it means a slightly smaller chance they’ll win the prize themselves.</p>
<p>Make your quiz look nice—that will have an enormous impact on how well it does. Picture taking it yourself—does it look like a sloppy survey thrown together last minute, or is does it look like a million bucks? That may affect how likely people are to share their personal information with you.</p>
<p>Qzzr has designed a tool to make quizzes both simple and visually engaging. Here are a few examples of quizzes designed to promote contests and giveaways.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for determining which Frozen character I am, or finding out how well I know Armenian pop songs from the 80s. In fact, I consider these basic human needs—equal in importance to food, water, and shelter.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1446  alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shopping-cart-294547_640-300x284.png" alt="shopping-cart-294547_640" width="273" height="258" />Nonetheless, the value of quizzes can extend past this. In particular, many top brands have been realizing incredible ecommerce conversion rates by incorporating quizzes into their content strategies.</p>
<p>How do they do this? Like any good marketing effort, it begins with a goal. Of course, while the ultimate objective of any ecommerce company is found in the latter part of that word—commerce—a successful company will break this down into smaller, more easily measured and influenced metrics. Examples may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand awareness/recognition</li>
<li>Web traffic</li>
<li>Email subscriptions</li>
<li>Data acquisition</li>
<li>Revenue</li>
<li>Decreased bounce rate</li>
<li>Improved organic search</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at five brands in particular, and how quizzes are helping them bring home the bacon.</p>
<h4>Zenni Optical</h4>
<p><a title="UPDATE: The Quiz That Has Generated Over $250,000" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/update-quiz-generated-250000/" target="_blank">We’ve spoken about these guys before</a>, but when it comes to ecommerce success, they’re the crown jewel. To date, their <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank"><em>You’ve Been Framed</em> quiz</a> has been taken over 415,000 times, generated over 23,000 leads, and has generated nearly $400,000 in revenue. And the best part is that the thing&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; conifer – as evergreen as green can be. They&#8217;ve long stopped promoting it, but it keeps churning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Zenni-Optical-Conversion.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1445" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Zenni-Optical-Conversion.png" alt="Zenni Optical Conversion" width="1028" height="118" /></a></p>
<p>We’ll give this some more detail as we go along, but one of the secrets to this quiz’s success is its role as a decision engine. It takes a difficult scenario – selecting the right eyeglass frame for your style, features, activity level, etc. – and asks simple questions to determine the best fit. True – they could&#8217;ve spelled it all out in a longform blog post or infographic, but they didn’t. The quiz draws people in and helps resolve one of the top obstacles causing bounce rate. This in turn drives revenue. And the result has been astounding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Qzzr-Zenni-New-Page-3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1442" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Qzzr-Zenni-New-Page-3.png" alt="Qzzr - Zenni - New Page (3)" width="1140" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Update 6/2/15: This quiz has now generated more than 31,000 new leads and over $1 million in revenue. Incredible!</em></strong></p>
<h4>Sideshow Collectibles</h4>
<p>When figurine studio Sideshow Collectibles was faced with the challenge of launching a new lineup, they <a href="http://courtofthedead.com/which-court-of-the-dead-faction-are-you/" target="_blank">created a quiz to sort fans into various factions</a> integral to the overarching story, Court of the Dead. At the end of the quiz, people were presented with a coupon and an opportunity to win a limited edition figurine from the collection.</p>
<p>The result was astounding. Of the nearly 37,000 people that took the quiz, Sideshow Collectibles generated over 22,000 leads. That’s a 60% ecommerce conversion rate(!), which as of October had directly prompted over 1,800 orders and more than $75,000 in sales.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Court-of-the-Dead-Conversion.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1436" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Court-of-the-Dead-Conversion-1024x116.png" alt="Court of the Dead Conversion" width="1024" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>As if that was not enough, by using the questions they did, they had acquired invaluable amounts of data about those subscribers in a way that would allow targeted marketing automation down the road. As far as quiz strategy goes, <a href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/content/18981.html" target="_blank">this case study is the cream of the crop</a>.</p>
<h4>Lime Ricki</h4>
<p>Like Zenni Optical, this modest swimwear brand is <a href="http://blog.limericki.com/what-swimsuit-suits-you-quiz/" target="_blank">using the power or quizzes as a decision engine</a>. By addressing and eliminating one of the largest obstacles in their customers’ minds – indecision or self-consciousness about the style or fit of a swimsuit – they’ve increased web traffic, sales and email subscriptions.</p>
<p>In addition, the success of this quiz proves potential for quizzes to serve a sales/support role for ecommerce brands. Instead of occupying a salesperson’s time to get recommendations, the quiz is able to direct them to products that fit their body type, interests, color preferences, and more.</p>
<h4>Kettlebell Fever</h4>
<p>It can be easy to get overwhelmed by stories of the big brands, with marketing campaigns blowing past 300,000 leads or more. But it’s important to note that the concept remains the same for small businesses. A perfect example of this is a fitness company called Kettlebell Fever. Their quiz has been taken 549 times, bringing in 100 leads. An 18% ecommerce conversion rate was a big deal for them, and ended up being a nice revenue tick.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-08-at-1.41.41-PM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1443 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-08-at-1.41.41-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="118" /></a></p>
<h4>Pampadour</h4>
<p>Another great example of this came from <a href="http://blog.pampadour.com/beauty-addict-game-hosted-pampadour/" target="_blank">Pampadour</a>, a Pinterest-style network for those wanting to share beauty products and techniques. In trying to expand their blog’s reach, they launched a quiz—paired with a giveaway—that netted them 163 leads, with a 52% conversion rate. That goes a long way in the early days of a blog, as does landing customer data that will allow systematic, interest-based marketing automation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pampadour-Conversion.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1438" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pampadour-Conversion-1024x116.png" alt="Pampadour Conversion" width="1024" height="116" /></a></p>
<h4>Wrap-Up</h4>
<p>In the world of marketing, few tactics bring in those conversion rates. You may be skeptical <a title="Why Quizzes?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/quiz-generated-124000-revenue-counting/" target="_blank">I told you</a> about a quiz that had generated over $124,000 in revenue for an eyewear company called Zenni Optical. Here is what I said at the time:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>This quiz has been taken more than 140,000 times, but that’s not even the best part. Zenni was able to capture 7,000 email addresses, and the quiz helped generate $124,000 in revenue (<strong>and counting</strong>).</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out that quiz had A LOT of counting left to do.</p>
<p>I just talked to one of the people who helped create that quiz, and he said the quiz was still a gold mine. It has now been taken over 300,000 times, generated <strong>more than 16,000 new leads, </strong>and<strong> </strong>produced <strong>$259,496.20 in revenue</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a <strong>quarter million dollars</strong> off of one quiz.</p>
<p>You can see this quiz for yourself here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/f094ba79-35f3-4df3-90c2-bc7e502466e3.png" alt="zenni frames quiz" width="460" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>And guess what? It’s not done yet. I can’t wait to follow up with them in a couple months to get an update on how the quiz is doing.</p>
<p>Nothing makes us happier than seeing our users get out-of-this-world results with their quizzes. Whether your quiz generates over a quarter million dollars or entertains your family at a reunion, we’re here to celebrate all of your victories.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 dir="ltr"><em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This post is part of a series documenting Lucidchart&#8217;s experiment with using quizzes for B2B marketing.</span></em></h4>
<p>We’ve had a great time using Qzzr as a marketing tool and we’ve been pleased with the preliminary results. In this final post, we discuss narrowing our quiz strategy, using Qzzr to make a quiz, and our results metrics.</p>
<p><span id="more-1262"></span><b>Narrowing our focus</b></p>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.qzzr.com/b2b-marketing-online-quizzes-part-2-choosing-quiz-topics/" target="_blank">our last post</a>, we outlined our strategy to use two different sets of quizzes for this test run with Qzzr. One quiz would be aimed at our existing customers, while the other would be pushed out on Twitter to generate new leads. As we wrote the quizzes, however, we decided to focus on just one.</p>
<p>We wanted to put all our focus on the quiz aimed at existing customers, because we already have a huge volume of leads: customers who use the free version of the service but have not upgraded to paid or team accounts. So we posted the quiz to our blog, advertised it on social media, and sent out a targeted mailing to some of our many unpaid customers. We chose to target customers who had signed up for our service in the last few months, but hadn’t made a diagram yet.</p>
<p><b>Writing the quiz</b></p>
<p>Writing the quiz proved to be a challenge for our team. We wanted to find the right balance between something fun to take and something that would also be useful to our customers. Plus, since we have a very diverse userbase, we wanted to make sure our “fun” questions were broad and relatable enough to engage all kinds of people.</p>
<p>Happily, the experience of building a quiz with Qzzr wasn’t challenging at all. The interface was sleek and intuitive, and it was easy to modify questions, add pictures to each question, and write up the results sections. We were even able to add a coupon code at the end of the quiz that led to a team trial—a big plus for us, since users on a team trial are more likely to pay for Lucidchart in the future.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-auto-redirect="true" data-quiz="25263"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p><b>Reviewing results</b></p>
<p>Once we had published the quiz for a few weeks and sent out our first mailing, we were ready to look at our statistics. We had a 1% open rate for our mailing that advertised the quiz, and a 7% click through rate for those who opened the email and followed the link to the quiz.</p>
<p>Of those who took the quiz from all channels, 10% clicked on the coupon offer at the end to upgrade to a paid Lucidchart account. We were very pleased with this metric, and because of it, we’re considering a similar email campaign that would be sent to more users.</p>
<p>One thing that surprised us was that the quiz still managed to attract first-time registrations, despite the fact that our email was only sent to current customers. We are still exploring how this happened, but it seems to be a result of people finding the blog post organically and being curious enough to take it.</p>
<p>Overall, we had a great time using quizzes for marketing and the results were better than we expected. We’ll continue to experiment with this new marketing strategy to engage existing users and attract new ones. We’d like to try posting quizzes directly on our social media accounts, as well as directly to sites like Qzzr, rather than just embedding them.</p>
<p>Lucidchart has been growing rapidly. We’ve have been getting great coverage from places like <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/309297/lucidchart-replaces-visio-on-mac/">Cult of Mac</a> and other places around the web, which helps us grow the top of our funnel and register new users. We’re excited to be using innovative marketing techniques like quizzes to help convert those new users to paid accounts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last summer, ESPN&#8217;s Bill Simmons <a href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-national-sports-collectors-convention/" target="_blank">paid his annual visit</a> to the National Sports Collectors Convention in Cleveland. He said this event &#8220;ranks somewhere between the Fourth of July and <em>Sharknado</em>&#8221; on his scale of &#8220;Favorite Annual Summer Traditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Simmons, two things will always be a major part of any collectors convention: Mickey Mantle and <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what people will always love collecting? Mickey Mantle and Star Wars. In that order,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;They were asking $1,600 for (an) unopened box of <em>Star Wars</em> cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, people love their <em>Star Wars</em>. There is an entire <a href="Han_shot_first" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> solely dedicated to whether Han Solo or Greedo shot first in their confrontation—and that page <a href="http://stats.grok.se/en/latest30/Han%20shot%20first" target="_blank">has been viewed</a> more than 26,000 times in the last 30 days:</p>
<p><a href="http://stats.grok.se/en/latest30/Han%20shot%20first" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-452" src="http://blog.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-18-at-11.54.07-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-18 at 11.54.07 AM" width="819" height="423" /></a></p>
<p>So&#8230; yeah. There&#8217;s plenty of people out there who feel passionately about <em>Star Wars. </em>With the release of the first teaser trailer for the new<i> Star Wars </i>movie, the fever pitch was particularly high, and so <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/" target="_blank">GamesRadar</a>, a video game website, capitalized by launching a quiz titled, &#8220;<a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/do-you-really-know-star-wars/" target="_blank">How much do you actually know about <em>Star Wars</em>?</a>&#8221; The quiz has now been taken <strong>more than 36,000 times</strong>.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="27582" data-h="nrrv&lt;))qqq(agkcutgbgt(eik)bi+is+tcgjj+mhiq+urgt+qgtu)"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script><br />
The thing about passionate fan bases is they&#8217;re always ready to prove their knowledge. So when they hear someone issue a challenge, such as, &#8220;How much do you <em>actually</em> know about your favorite movie series?&#8221; they are all over it. Quizzes are a fantastic way to lay down the gauntlet to such audiences. &#8220;Think you know a lot about (fill in the blank)? Prove it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the first step in creating a great quiz is knowing your audience. It just so happened that GamesRadar knew that their audience was into <em>Star Wars</em>, and this worked in their favor since <em>Star Wars</em> has some of the most passionate fans in the world. But if you dig into the interests of your audience, you&#8217;re bound to find something a majority feel passionately about. It might be One Direction. It could be NPR. Or, if we&#8217;ve learned anything from the National Sports Collectors Convention, it could be Mickey Mantle.</p>
<p>Either way, if you are able to hone in on a passionate fan base, you might have a viral quiz on your hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I became a parent 7 months ago, and in preparation for the baby&#8217;s birth, I had to assemble a bunch of furniture: a crib, a dresser, and a rocking chair (to name a few). As someone who is mechanically challenged, I relied heavily on the accompanying step-by-step guides. I couldn&#8217;t have gotten the job done without them.</p>
<p>As helpful as they were, though, I had no desire to share my new knowledge on Facebook.</p>
<p>I bring this up because of the success of a <a href="http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2014/09/12/how-well-do-you-know-your-nikon-camera-quiz/" target="_blank">quiz</a> posted by <a href="http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/" target="_blank">Digital Camera World</a>, an outstanding website that provides digital photography tips and techniques, digital camera reviews, photo editing lessons, and video tutorials. Their quiz, &#8220;How well do you know your Nikon camera?&#8221;, was essentially a collection of step-by-step photos from camera tutorials, and they were able to engage their audience by having them guess which image showed the best settings for the scenario presented.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="18525"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>&#8220;It was easy to make, easy to share, and what&#8217;s more, we found more than 10% of the people who took the quiz signed up for our newsletter to learn more Nikon tips,&#8221; said Jeff Meyer, Website Editor at Digital Camera World. &#8220;It&#8217;s been so successful that we&#8217;re working regular quizzes into our content plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a brilliant way to repurpose content that some would consider boring and dry (step-by-step photos from camera tutorials) and made it something fun and worth sharing with their friends. People like to be challenged and assessed, and if you can provide them with a fun experience that accomplishes both of these motives, the leads and traffic will come pouring in.</p>
<p>Yes, people love learning about which Disney Princess or character from Friends they are. But they also want to be educated, but sometimes the most useful content can be a bit&#8230;dry. Even though we all feared quizzes in school, they have proven to be a healthy medium for delivering all types of content, from the most playful to the most educational.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last summer, my wife and I were heading out for a weekend at the lake. I had just bought a new pair of aviator sunglasses and was excited to try them out.</p>
<p>Within one millisecond of seeing me with my new sunglasses, my wife said, &#8220;Absolutely not. You can&#8217;t pull off aviators.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gotta be honest – that stung a little.</p>
<p>Then, a few weeks ago, I came across a <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank">quiz</a> from Zenni Optical that said it could help me discover the perfect frames for my budget and lifestyle. I was eager to see if this assessment would agree with my wife.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-439 size-full" src="http://blog.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/f094ba79-35f3-4df3-90c2-bc7e502466e3.png" alt="f094ba79-35f3-4df3-90c2-bc7e502466e3" width="460" height="332" /></a>If you must know, my wife was right – I didn&#8217;t get aviators. But, I did discover that I could pull off <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/trendy-eyeglasses/vintage-style-glasses" target="_blank">vintage-style frames</a>. And it felt pretty good to show that to my wife.</p>
<p>It turns out, there are a lot of people who want to know which frames are best for them. This quiz has been taken more than 140,000 times, but that&#8217;s not even the best part. Zenni was able to capture 7,000 email addresses, and the quiz helped generate $124,000 in revenue (and counting).</p>
<p>Those results are nuts. They&#8217;re a testament to the creativity and ingenuity of the people out there creating quizzes. If you give your audiences content they love, they&#8217;ll want to buy what you&#8217;re selling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve likely encountered your fair share of &#8220;Which Disney/Star Wars/Game of Thrones/Hunger Games/Fill-in-the-blank Character are You?&#8221; quizzes. These quizzes are indeed popular, but they are not your only choice. Another popular quiz type is the compare and contrast quiz.</p>
<p><strong> Examples of Compare and Contrast Quizzes</strong></p>
<p>What do we mean by compare and contrast quiz? Let&#8217;s take a look at a couple creative quizzes that use this technique as an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6988585/quiz-nfl-player-or-key-peele-character" target="_blank">NFL Player or Key &amp; Peele Character</a> &#8211; Key &amp; Peele is a sketch comedy show starring Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Their characters often had unusual names &#8212; as do many NFL players. This compare and contrast quiz asks questions such as:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-425" src="http://blog.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-12-at-10.05.06-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-12 at 10.05.06 AM" width="608" height="353" /></p>
<p>As the person taking the quiz, it&#8217;s up to you to figure out if the person in question is an NFL player or a Key &amp; Peele character. This quiz is fun because some of the names are so unusual you think they couldn&#8217;t possibly be real. Surprisingly, seemingly fake names are real.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6979812/quiz-game-of-thrones-or-creed-video" target="_blank">Game of Thrones Scene or Creed Video</a> &#8211; Both Game of Thrones and Creed videos feature dark and lavish scenery, making it difficult for even the most devoted of fans to distinguish between actual Game of Thrones scenes or a Creed video. Not only is this compare and contrast quiz fun because it appeals to fans of either franchise, it is also highly visual. It puts your knowledge to the test and challenges what you thought you knew you in a non-threatening manner. It also draws a parallel to the two different elements that you may not have noticed before.</p>
<p><strong> Benefits of Compare and Contrast Quizzes</strong></p>
<p>Compare and contrast quizzes offer several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Wide appeal</strong> &#8211; These online quizzes can appeal to two diverse groups as well. For example, NFL fans may have never heard of Key &amp; Peele, yet they&#8217;ll likely check out the quiz. The same is true of the Game of Thrones Scene versus Creed Video quiz. Not only does this quiz tap into the huge Game of Thrones fan base, it also appeals to rockers.</li>
<li><strong> Potential to go viral</strong> &#8211; Whether you scored poorly or aced the quiz, you&#8217;ll want to share it with your friends who share your passion for either Games of Thrones or Creed simply based on the subject matter alone. If you aced the quiz, of course you&#8217;ll want to show off. If you didn&#8217;t do so well, sharing a low score on an NFL Player vs. Key &amp; Peele quiz isn&#8217;t nearly as embarrassing as flunking the US citizenship test.</li>
<li><strong> Easy to write once you have the topic</strong> &#8211; Once you have the topic figured out, these quizzes practically write themselves. For example, let&#8217;s say you want to write a compare and contrast quiz such as &#8220;Fictional Hero or Real Life Hero.&#8221; Once you have that topic nailed, all you need to do is look up lists of both types of heroes and present them in your compare and contrast quiz. For example, John McClane (fictional) and John McCain (real life).</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 dir="ltr"><em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This post is part of a series documenting our experiment with using quizzes for B2B marketing. <a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/b2b-marketing-online-quizzes/">Last week</a> we talked about our decision to try out quizzes for our online marketing approach. This week we discuss how we built our campaign around this new technology.</span></em></h4>
<p>At Lucidchart we live and breathe diagrams. Our company operates under a SaaS model targeting different personas: IT/Engineering, Product Management and Design, and Business. We offer both free accounts and paid Pro subscriptions for our <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com">diagramming tool</a>. Our goal as a marketing department is to build awareness for our product and convince people to pay for the Pro version after trying it for free.</p>
<p>So we decided to create a quiz campaign with topics that would easily fit into our existing marketing funnel.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Brainstorming</h3>
<p dir="ltr">To best determine what those quizzes should be, we started with a rapid-fire brainstorming session, keeping the funnel in mind. We brainstormed ideas that would appeal to both existing and potential customers. At this stage, even silly ideas were welcomed since they helped us approach the task with an open mind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We eliminated topics by asking ourselves key questions: where in the funnel would this quiz apply? Which areas of the funnel did we want to target? We organized our brainstormed topics around the marketing funnel, then the selected topics (highlighted in red below) we thought would move customers down the funnel in clear, measurable ways. Keep in mind that rejected topics may still have potential marketing value, so it’s a good idea to save your work.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/d170bda8-e3a9-4184-bef4-5da5fdfc5d30/0?callback=close&amp;v=862&amp;s=612"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/m_dfYupK_3lbx8gxnwIfdFDDwu2CZdBS0CCYfjPKieuHFzgVTsGM09cLt5KiB3FqJi3pXsfq2GP1gwtjE2TI4fTZLcROCw9xRWC2phUkoT9USbuFCmPFSpKNOAUViIeyhg" alt="" width="NaN" height="NaN" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Product Awareness</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Our first quiz set matches up with the top of the marketing funnel. It focuses on creating awareness, interest, and consideration for our product. We decided to use “Are you an expert in…?” style quizzes that applied to diagrams, e.g. “Are you an expert in entity-relationship diagrams?” or “How well do you know flowcharts?” We are limiting this set to diagram-types that we know have a high rate of ROI, like flowcharts and org charts. These types of quizzes are popular online right now because, let’s face it, people are vain. They like to post their quiz results on social media to let everyone know how smart they are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To advertise this series of quizzes, we’ll be using targeted promoted tweets. We’ve had success with promoted tweets leading to high click-through rates before, and we’re comfortable running PPC campaigns. After they take our quiz, readers will be prompted to provide their email address for more quizzes, diagramming tips, and info about diagramming software from Lucidchart. Since anyone who clicks on the quiz is likely to be a frequent diagrammer, they’ll be more inclined to sign up.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Product Purchasing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Our second quiz set was targeted to users farther down the marketing funnel, under intent, evaluation, and purchase. We have a large base of unpaid users that we want to a.) retain and b.) eventually convert to paid users. So we are planning to send an email blast out to unpaid users with a quiz titled “What kind of diagram should I use for my next project?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">We chose this topic because it shamelessly shows off Lucidchart’s best features, including those that many users may not be aware of (e.g. <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/tour/ER_diagram_tool">ER diagrams</a>). Additionally, if the quiz taker’s answers result in a diagram type that’s included in our Pro version, we can invite them to purchase a Pro account. We’ll even have a convenient discount offer right at the end of the quiz. We are always looking to convert our users to paid subscriptions without being too pushy, and we think this is a perfect way to do that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that we’ve determined our topics and strategy, it’s time to write and post our quizzes. Depending on how things go, we may need to update our strategy or tweak our topics—so we’ll keep you posted here on our continued progress. For now, we’re excited to finally be diving into Qzzr’s software!</p>
