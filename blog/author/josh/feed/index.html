				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s time. Over the last several months, we’ve seen thousands of quizzes taken millions of times created by some of the largest publishers on the planet.</p>
<p><span id="more-1026"></span>We’ve been learning a ton by watching trends and reviewing the data. Each little thing we’ve learned I’ve wanted to shout from the mountain tops, but I’ve exercised some great restraint in holding off until we had a full picture.</p>
<p>So, why do people share awesome content?</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Qzzr, we’ve been running tests and making constant improvements to every part of the quiz taking experience. One of the most tested aspects of the experience has been the share rates. Much of what we found was expected, but some of what we’ve learned has been quite surprising to us.</p>
<p>Why are shares so important to us? In short, because they are important to our customers. We feel we have an obligation to our customers to create not only the most beautiful and easy-to-use quiz creation tool, but also the most sharable. Qzzr use cases are about as broad as the horizon, but the one common theme across all of them is shares. Everyone wants more shares.</p>
<p>As the social web continues to evolve, we want our customers to be in the center of it along side the most shared content on the web. This is normally where I would elaborate about the value of shares, but I’m not going to do that as I think there is already enough said about that. I’d rather focus my time on sharing what we’ve learned about why people share and what you can do about it. Here are a bunch of experiments we’ve conducted and the results we’ve seen.</p>
<h3><b>Experiment &#8211; The Results Page</b></h3>
<p>The number one compliment we get from our customers (by a long margin) is about our design. It’s usually something tied to simplicity, usability, or just plain ol’ pretty pixels. We love that. We try really hard to not only create a product that works well, but looks good while doing it. This is why we were sort of surprised by the result of this experiment.</p>
<p>We started with a nice looking layout like this and attempted to beat it:</p>
<p><b>Control (share rate of 5.01%)</b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1361" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/control-share-rate.png" alt="control share rate" width="600" height="593" /></p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<p>A bunch of stuff. We started by changing the share buttons from circles to rectangles. Then we made them look more normal. Made them a little smaller. Made the background image smaller and moved it around the page. Added a share pop-up. Reduced the share options. Bumped up the share button.</p>
<p>With all of these tweaks, we decided to run an experiment and keep what worked and abort what didn’t.</p>
<p>At the end, we ended up with this:</p>
<p><b>Test (share rate of 14.77%)</b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1362" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/test-share-rate.png" alt="test share rate" width="600" height="619" /></p>
<p>We wouldn’t have bet on it, but this layout beat the initial design. And when I say beat it, it slaughtered it. This really simple design increased the share rate over the control by 295% in a test of over 18,401 sessions. What’s more amazing is these results were for quizzes taken on our site. The share rate for quizzes embedded on our customers’ websites was much higher.</p>
<p>We’ve not been able to beat the rates on this design. As hard as it is for us to stick with something so plain looking, we understand that we’re in the business of sharable content. The crowd has spoken.</p>
<h3><b>Experiment &#8211; Share Image</b></h3>
<p>Getting more shares is only part of the potential. If we get tons of people to share, but no one clicks through, we’ve really done no better. Because most of our shares are on social media, with most of those (84%) being on Facebook, we decided to see if we could increase the click through rate of shares on Facebook. While we’ve already optimized the share text pretty well, we decided to see if we could make an impact with swapping out the images.</p>
<p>On our first test, we tried these four images.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1363" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/share-image-1.png" alt="share image 1" width="600" height="377" /></p>
<p>And here are the results (a screenshot directly from our report on Facebook)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1364" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/results1.png" alt="results1" width="600" height="355" /></p>
<p>What? Are you telling me that that little bit of text and a button increased the click through rate of the quiz by over 300%? Yes. I’m afraid so.</p>
<p>BUT that’s a really popular topic. Peyton Manning was hot at the time. What about a more tame, less clickworthy topic…&#8230;like introversion?</p>
<p>Here’s our second test.  We ran these four images.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1365" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/share-image-2.png" alt="share image 2" width="600" height="413" /></p>
<p>And the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1366" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/results2.png" alt="results2" width="600" height="217" /></p>
<p>The pattern remained with the topic of introversion.  In fact, now we see an increase of over 4x over the image only.<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>If you would have asked me about the effect of laying white Impact font on top of images, I would have guessed an increase in click-through rate in the single digit percentages (or a possible decrease). I would have never guessed that it would lead to an increase in the <em>triple</em> digits. Again, the crowd has spoken. Let there be Impact font for all.</p>
<h3><b>Graded vs. Outcome</b></h3>
<p>Now let’s focus on the content. Is there a difference in the share rate of a graded quiz over an outcome quiz?</p>
<p>Shortly after we first launched the outcome quiz type we saw initial results that indicated outcome quizzes had a significant share advantage over graded quizzes. Now that we have a mountain of data, it’s clear that this initial reading was false. Over the last 6 months, outcome quizzes and graded quizzes have an almost identical share rate. Interestingly, they are also about 50/50 in total completions within the Qzzr world. Some of the most popular Qzzr quizzes have been graded quizzes.</p>
<h3><b>Graded Quiz Share Rates</b><strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></h3>
<p>So now that we know that quiz types are pretty equal in terms of share rates, let’s look to see if there is a difference in the outcomes within those quiz types.  Is there a difference in share rate based on the score of a graded quiz?</p>
<p><b>Share rates of graded quizzes</b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1367" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/share-breakdown1.png" alt="share breakdown1" width="600" height="409" /></p>
<p>Ummm. Yes. There is. Let’s call this the Pareto principle of shares.  Almost 80% (76%) of shares come from people who scored in the top 20%. And an astounding 45% of shares come from people with a perfect score. Only 12% of shares came from scores of 69% and below.</p>
<p>What can we learn from this? People share things that make them look smart or feel good. If you want your quiz to be shared, help them do well on it.</p>
<h3><b>Outcome Quiz Share Rates</b></h3>
<p>So you probably could have guessed that people who score better were more likely to share on graded quizzes, but what about outcome quizzes? Is someone that gets Rick on the <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/walking_dead_character_personality_quiz_amc-2014-10" target="_blank">Walking Dead quiz</a> more likely to share than someone who gets the Governor? Well, we can answer that.</p>
<p><b>Which Walking Dead Character Are You?</b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1368" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/walking-dead-data.png" alt="walking dead data" width="600" height="291" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1369" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/walking-dead-share-breakdown.png" alt="walking dead share breakdown" width="533" height="599" /></p>
<p>As a fan of the show, this is really interesting to me. On the surface it would seem like Rick, the main character and hero figure of the show, should get the most shares. This would match the “look good in front of my friends” behavior of graded quizzes, right?</p>
<p>But if you have followed the show and watched every episode (as I have), these results make more sense. Although Rick is the main character, he’s been put in situations where he had to compromise his values for either the safety of his group or personal benefit. Both Carol and Daryl are supporting characters, but unlike Rick, they have stayed true to who they are. In their own way, their tactics ring true with who we all probably want to be in a zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the share rate.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1370" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/share-rate-walking-dead.png" alt="share rate walking dead" width="600" height="480" /></p>
<p>Because of the volume of results that got Rick, the rate was even lower. 80,012 people got the result of Rick, but only 833 chose to share it. This is a very low share rate. Compare that to the 1,312 people who shared out of the 7,709 who got Daryl.</p>
<p>Is AMC reading this? I hope so because this really needs to inform the storyline. Don’t kill off Daryl or Carol. Rick….well…..sorry bud.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another one of my favorites.</p>
<p><b>Which Goonie Are You?</b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1371" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/goonie-share-data.png" alt="goonie share data" width="600" height="341" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1372" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/goonies-share-rate-graph.png" alt="goonies share rate graph" width="600" height="551" /></p>
<p>Let’s talk about share rate first this time. This quiz has a really great share rate, and it’s very evenly distributed amongst the characters. That probably speaks to the warm spot that everyone has in their heart for all of the characters and the movie itself. Even poor Sloth was shared by the people who got him as a result.<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1373" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/goonies-share-breakdown.png" alt="goonies share breakdown" width="543" height="658" /></p>
<p>When you look at share breakdown it’s a different story. In terms of total number of shares, Mouth takes the cake with Mikey, Chunk, and Andy almost tying for second. Why is this? Isn’t Mouth the misfit supporting character? Why wouldn’t Mikey get shared more than mouth? He didn’t compromise his values in the face of a zombie apocalypse or anything like that.  <strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>Well, yes, but although Mouth wasn’t the main character, he was portrayed as the confident, cool, and witty one while Mikey was sort of the asthmatic normal guy with low self-esteem. Again, people are more willing to share results that make them look good. Case in point: poor Sloth.</p>
<p><b>Which New Car Should You Buy?</b></p>
<p>So, if we’re not convinced that people share results that make them look good, let’s look at <a href="http://carbuying.jalopnik.com/what-car-should-you-buy-take-this-quiz-1670353893" target="_blank">this car quiz</a> created by Jason Torchinsky:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1374" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/car-share-data.png" alt="car share data" width="600" height="332" /></p>
<p>Although this quiz has a somewhat low share rate, we can see that it’s pretty constant.  <strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>Question:  What do you think is more likely to get shared &#8211; a result of a high priced car or a low priced car?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/share-rate-vs-sticker-price.png" alt="share rate vs sticker price" width="600" height="329" /></p>
<p>You guessed it. Share rates track very closely to average sticker price of the cars.  It’s almost like you could predict the share behavior. <img src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b><strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></h3>
<p>So, it’s pretty clear that if you want your content to be shared, there are a few things you can do to make that happen more often.</p>
<p>First, use a tool that is going to be optimized for shares. We think Qzzr is a good choice, but you are free to choose for yourself. <img src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Also, life is short, so help people look good. Qzzr quizzes are meant to be fun. Unless your quiz is meant to be “the most difficult” quiz in a certain topic (which is pretty effective also, BTW), give people a fair shot at doing well. That means no trick questions, and be sure to provide clear answer options. Incidentally, sometimes negative results (like the Governor from Walking Dead) can also help people look good because it’s funny.</p>
<p>We’re going to keep an eye on this share rate thing and continue to optimize Qzzr, and we will bring you the best data we can find to help you create the most sharable content on the web.  In the meantime, take a minute and <a href="http://kentamplinvocalacademy.com/" target="_blank">learn how to sing better than anyone else</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had the wonderful opportunity in my career to be a public school teacher, corporate trainer, small business owner, learning strategist for Fortune 500 companies, and creator of the world&#8217;s foremost enterprise social learning platform.  I&#8217;ve either used, tested, or been a reseller of all of the top learning management systems on the market today.</p>
<p>When I was working with our clients at my first company, <a href="http://meetmaestro.com/">Maestro</a>, they would come to us with a list of 900 features that their learning management system would need to do.  This is no joke&#8230;imagine a word doc with 16 pages of bullet points of &#8220;things our LMS needs to do.&#8221;  Being the dubious consultants we were, we would work diligently to find them the right solution that could slice, dice, chop, bake, rake, and mow for them.  In the end, we would setup the system for them and provide all of the necessary training for them to operate every one of those 900 features.  Then, we would send them on their merry way with their new system with every bell and whistle their heart desired.  Success, right?</p>
<p>As I said, we were good consultants, so we would keep tabs on how well the system we built was working for our clients.  Because we wouldn&#8217;t hear much from them, we would check in with them from time to time.  What we found was that people would only be using 5 of those 900 &#8220;gotta have&#8221; features.  Although in theory all of those extra features made sense, in practice they just didn&#8217;t.  Against the backdrop of a busy day with deadlines and being pulled in a thousand directions, who has time to create a custom scheduled memorized report that emails a certain group when if/then criteria are met within certain parameters?  That stuff is useless in the real world.  What we found people really need to know is who took a quiz, when did they take it, how did they score, was it a passing score, and who didn&#8217;t pass.  That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Qzzr is not an LMS&#8230;.but it does have those 5 features that people actually use and need.  When we were contemplating building Qzzr, we knew that  most of the people using LMS&#8217;s out there today are only using it as a way to host quizzes and track scores.   I&#8217;ve personally seen it hundreds of times.   The content can be hosted anywhere, it&#8217;s really the quiz that needs to be tracked.</p>
<p>We wanted to create a way for anyone to create a quiz in minutes and embed or link that quiz from anywhere and be able to track the scores.  This can be used by team managers who just want a simple quiz at the end of a presentation they are sending out.  It could be used by sales teams who want to certify all of their sales reps on the new product launch materials sent out.  It could be used by professors who just don&#8217;t want to deal with that clunky LMS.  It could be used by students as a way to create study materials.  It could be used by corporate trainers who want to offer a series of quizzes to their new training class.  Qzzr offers all of the useful features of an LMS in a simple, easy-to-use interface.</p>
<p>And&#8230;.you can&#8217;t beat the price <img src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>As usual.  I wish you happy quizzing.</p>
<p>Josh Little</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We work really hard to make your quizzes look beautiful. The power of images can turn a plain looking quiz into a rich, visual bonanza very quickly. We receive lots of questions about the use if images in Qzzr. This post will hopefully answer some of those questions and educate you a little on the proper use of images for creative works.</p>
<p><strong>To save you some time, here is the bottom line &#8211; the use of images in Qzzr is no different than the use of images anywhere else on the web or in creative works &#8211; you need to either own the image or have license to use it.</strong></p>
<p>For a little more information, read on.</p>
<p><strong>If I find an image on a Google image search, can I use it?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe.  Google Images is a powerful search tool and can display images from anywhere on the web.  Just because an image can be found on the internet, does not mean it is free to copy and use.  Luckily, Google has made it super easy to sort by usage rights (see below).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1349" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2015-03-04-at-2.54.06-PM.png" alt="alaska labeled for reuse" width="1000" height="359" /></p>
<p><strong>What if I&#8217;m not using the quiz for commercial purposes?</strong></p>
<p>It still doesn&#8217;t matter. You must have permission or license to use an image for any creative work. There are, for certain circumstances, guidelines for the fair use of images or copyrighted works without needing to gain permission from the creator. There are a couple helpful articles on fair use on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">U.S. Copyright Office.</a></p>
<p><strong>Can I just attribute the image to the creator or source?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, but that still doesn&#8217;t make it legal. Giving credit through attribution does avoid plagiarism, but it still does not give you legal permission unless the license says so.</p>
<p><strong>What if I make changes to the image?</strong></p>
<p>Making changes to an image does not make it yours. If you do not own the rights to the image, there is no amount of changes you can make that will make it yours.</p>
<p><strong>Is Qzzr liable for my use of images?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. We cannot accept liability as it&#8217;s impossible for us to know if you have permission or not. We make it clear in our <a href="https://www.qzzr.co/terms">Terms of Service</a> that we forbid the use of posting any images that do not have permission from the owner. We deal with copyright infringement accordance to the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.</p>
<p><strong>So, where can I find good images?</strong></p>
<p>There are millions of legal and free images that can be found on the web. Just search for &#8220;royalty free images&#8221; or &#8220;creative commons images&#8221; or use the Google images search tools to find the right usage rights for your needs. They may not have the exact image of a clown juggling chainsaws while eating an apple, but here are a few sources that we&#8217;ve found to help you along your quest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know them, and although you say they are silly&#8230;.you secretly LOVE them, those insanely viral outcome quizzes that you see all over the internet and in your social channels from sites like the NYTimes, BuzzFeed, and Zimbio.  Did you know the #1 article on the NYTimes last year was a quiz?  And it launched on December 21st, so it only had 10 days to gain that status.<span id="more-87"></span></p>
<p>These fun quiz questions are blowing up right now, but it&#8217;s nothing new.  It&#8217;s a basic human need to seek to understand ourselves.  This need can be met for fun and trivial ways like <a href="http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/dysfunctional-tv-family-belong-0808813#!zxqjI">&#8220;What dysfunctional TV family should you belong to?&#8221;</a> or more serious selection tools like <a href="https://www.qzzr.co/quiz/if-you-were-a-coffee-what-kind-of-coffee-would-you-be">&#8220;If you were a coffee, what kind of coffee would you be?&#8221;</a>   As with anything on the web, it boils down to great content, but with content as a constant, the social lift on these outcome-based quizzes has been astronomical.  We&#8217;re seeing share rates hovering around the high sixty percent range on some of our most viral quizzes.  That&#8217;s just insane!  With Qzzr, you can create the same sort of viral results for your own site, brand, or blog.</p>
<p><strong>How to make a great outcome based quiz.</strong></p>
<p>Content is king and with quizzes that rule holds true.  What makes a great quiz experience?  Who do some quizzes go viral and others don&#8217;t?  What&#8217;s the difference between a quiz that has a 68% share rate and a 28% share rate?  Since quizzes are our business, we&#8217;ve done the research and found several of these aspects to be true on the most popular viral quizzes.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Tell me about me&#8221; &#8211; Great quizzes let users take the &#8220;me drug&#8221; for just a couple minutes.  They ask thought provoking, personal questions.  The better the questions, the more likely the user will be to buy-in to the outcome, which means they will be more likely to share the outcome too.</li>
<li>&#8220;Make me look good&#8221; &#8211; Viral quizzes have many potential outcomes, but all of them either make the user look good or funny.  No one will share a quiz outcome that they aren&#8217;t proud of.</li>
<li>Relevant topics (duh) &#8211; the topic, title, content, and outcome are super relevant to the channel they are found in.  The more niche the topic and channel, the more likely the outcome will be shares.</li>
<li>They are fun &#8211; Great quizzes use humor to keep users smiling all the way to the end.   They do this with either great writing or interesting images.</li>
<li>Visually stimulating &#8211; the most viral quizzes have great visuals.  Qzzr allows tons of latitude in the use of images from animated GIF&#8217;s to transparent PNG&#8217;s</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you create the content?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made many of our own quizzes and watched others.  While everyone has their own process, it usually follows some version of this flow.</p>
<p>(often the first few steps are done on a scratch pad or a doc outside of Qzzr, which makes for faster copy/paste work when building the quiz)</p>
<p><strong>1. Determine your topic and title for the audience you&#8217;ll be creating the quiz for.</strong>  We&#8217;ve seen that the title of the quiz plays a massive role in the conversion from visits to quiz starts.  Popular titles for outcome quizzes are &#8220;What _____ am I?&#8221; or &#8220;What kind of _____ are you?&#8221;  or &#8220;What ______ should you _____?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2. Create the possible outcomes.</strong>  You&#8217;ll want to create enough outcomes so that when this gets shared on social media channels, people see various results and wonder what they are.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Determine the qualities that would differentiate the outcomes from one another.</strong>  This can be done on a scratch pad while doing research.  Here are the notes from a &#8220;What tech entrepreneur are you&#8221; quiz we recently created.  Notice that this is not an exhaustive list of qualities, but you can start to see some themes that could be used to differentiate &#8211; Male or female?  School of choice?  Dropout or not?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-93 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-2.26.17-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 2.26.17 PM" width="584" height="449" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Craft the questions.  </strong>The questions really fall out of the research that you&#8217;ve done to differentiate the outcomes.  Not all aspects of differentiation or interesting or appropriate, but you definitely want your respondents to feel sufficiently assessed.   While asking which baby&#8217;s face is cuter is a fun question, it does beg the question &#8220;what does this have to do with what job I should have and will I really trust the results?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5.  Source or create the images.</strong>  Great quizzes are visually stunning.  Qzzr makes that easy, but it does take some time and creativity to end up with a great result.  Here is a quiz that shows you some of the possibilities of what you can do with images if you get creative.<br />
<script src="https://www.qzzr.co/qzzr_loader.js" async="" type="text/javascript" data-quiz="what-is-qzzr" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></script><br />
<strong>6. Build the quiz in Qzzr.</strong>  This is the easy part.  We&#8217;ve removed all friction from the process.  Once the content is created it should be very quick to copy and paste content and drag and drop images.</p>
<p><strong>Start with your outcomes</strong> &#8211; remember to write interesting, positive outcome descriptions that make any outcome feel great to the person receiving it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-10.48.12-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 10.48.12 AM" width="1378" height="1263" /></p>
<p><strong>Carve out questions</strong> &#8211; you can use images to create buttons</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-2.47.46-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 2.47.46 PM" width="1220" height="1120" /></p>
<p>Make sure you set up your redirect link so that social shares redirect back to your embed location.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="wp-image-115 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-12.09.14-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-26 at 12.09.14 PM" width="324" height="180" /></strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Publish and embed</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> for your audience to enjoy</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-97" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-25-at-2.48.36-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-25 at 2.48.36 PM" width="966" height="816" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we continue to build the killer quiz tool for marketers and publishers, we now allow the ability to drive respondents to an offer based on the outcome of the quiz.</p>
<p>Why is this awesome?  There are plenty of ways to put a button or offer in front of someone on the web, but how many are immersed in a focused learning experience about your product, service, or brand?  Education is sales and sales is education.  It is usually the best educating brand or product that wins.  With the right content, a quiz can be the magic trigger for a buying decision because of the power of questions.  Questions open the mind to an answer or an outcome.  Are you a candidate for Lasik surgery?  What jacket fits your personality?  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;d really like to find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>On average, respondents spend 2 minutes and 17 seconds on a Qzzr quiz.  What will you say to them?  What questions will you ask that will lead them to find themselves in your product?</p>
<p><span id="more-991"></span></p>
<p><strong>Make targeted offers</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little quiz that any online retailer could create in minutes.  Let&#8217;s pretend backcountry.com made this one.  At the end, the person taking the quiz knows exactly what backpack they need based upon their habits, and so they will be directed to a 20% offer if they buy now. Compare the likelihood of this targeted offer to any ad or linkbait found on the web. How likely are they to buy?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s super simple.  Just go to <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">qzzr.com</a> and create a quiz.  Click on settings (gear), and then select “Edit messaging &amp; form.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1174" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.03.42-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.03.42 PM" width="600" height="568" /></p>
<p>Select &#8220;Provide Offer&#8221;, and then enter your offer title, description, button label, and link (with any tracking codes you have):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1175" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.14.04-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.14.04 PM" width="600" height="516" /></p>
<p>This is what the offer looks like on the results page of the quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1176" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.16.01-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.16.01 PM" width="600" height="405" /></p>
<p><strong>Alternative method &#8211; outcome based offers</strong></p>
<p>If you want to make a different offer based upon the outcome of the quiz, it&#8217;s simple.  You can add a link to the results text.  To get more fancy, you can add an href tag like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1177" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.21.37-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.21.37 PM" width="600" height="348" /></p>
<p>This is what it looks like on the results page of the quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1179" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-3.26.03-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 3.26.03 PM" width="600" height="251" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our next killer feature in building the ultimate content tool for marketers and publishers is the ability to get leads with a quiz.  Let us share just a few thoughts on why that is so exciting.  Most lead gen tools simply game the user into giving up their information.  They do this by dangling some sort of carrot like a gift or offer.</p>
<p>We have some questions about this approach &#8211; What kind of people enter their information?  Are they sincerely interested in your product or brand?  What quality are those leads?<span id="more-990"></span></p>
<p>With Qzzr, there are two main advantages over the other lead gen tools out there:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can help customers self-qualify for your product, service or brand by the questions you ask and by the feedback you give.  People spend an average of 2 minutes and 17 seconds taking a Qzzr quiz, so you have a few minutes of their undivided attention on the web. By the end of the quiz, you will have a good idea of who is most likely to convert into a paying customer. How important would that be to lead quality?</li>
<li>With Qzzr, you don&#8217;t just get a faceless email &#8211; you have extremely rich data to support exactly who this person is and how they think and feel.  How valuable would this be to your sales team?</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s a super-simple quiz that any car dealership could make in minutes.  In this example, we will offer the potential customer a $1,000 bonus on their trade in exchange for their email.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make a quiz like this</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just go to <a title="Qzzr" href="https://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">qzzr.com</a> and make a quiz for your blog, website, product, or brand. Before you publish the quiz, click on settings, and then select &#8220;Edit messaging and form&#8221; underneath &#8220;Leads &amp; Offers.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1169" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.33.43-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.33.43 PM" width="600" height="299" /> <a href="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.22.20-PM.png"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, select whether you want to capture emails, provide an offer, or get Facebook likes. In this example, we will select &#8220;Capture emails&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1169" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.33.43-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.33.43 PM" width="600" height="299" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, give people a reason to give you their email address. Write a compelling description that communicates the value you will offer them if they give you their information.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1171" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.36.18-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.36.18 PM" width="590" height="474" /></p>
<p>The form will show up above the result, allowing the quiz taker to consider your offer on the way to seeing their results. When someone finished taking your quiz, this is what they will see just before they get to their result:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1172" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-2.38.17-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-02 at 2.38.17 PM" width="600" height="410" /></p>
