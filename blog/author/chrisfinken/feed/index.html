				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to promoting your quizzes, Facebook can be your best friend. It is great for targeting, finding super-fans of quiz topics, and growing your customer base.</p>
<p>We’ve experimented with a variety of Facebook ads to help share awesome quizzes with the world and the results continue to amaze us. Here’s a quick overview of how to get the best results when you make a quiz and promote it on Facebook (or even an old quiz that you’d like to revive via Facebook).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Nail the initial post</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1344" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-9.07.21-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 9.07.21 AM" width="501" height="535" /></p>
<p>Start by getting the link to a quiz. Ideally, that link will be for a page from your own website that has the quiz embedded on it, but you can also use the Qzzr.com link if you don&#8217;t have it embedded anywhere.</p>
<p>Then, post that link to a Facebook post and make sure there is a published image. You can change the image by clicking on the change image button via Facebook but make sure it’s a clear description of what the quiz is and why it’s great.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your Facebook post is just like any other advertisement or marketing message you’ve ever worked with; it needs to be engaging, stand out, and have a call to action to really make it count.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Boost your post through Ads Manager</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve posted an update on Facebook, you’ll see the option to Boost your posts. This is a great way to improve engagement with any post and allows you very basic targeting options like posting to your fans, to a targeted group based on interests and set a budget.</p>
<p>For now let’s focus on doing this through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/advertising" target="_blank">Ads Manager</a> aspect of Facebook. That’s how you get your quiz in front of everyone and get the engagement your quiz deserves.</p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked on Create Ad in your Facebook ads manager you are given a number of advertising options. We recommend you focus on ‘Boost your posts’ which allows you to get engagement on your Facebook page AND your quiz. Win win.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1339" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-7.51.30-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 7.51.30 AM" width="380" height="404" /></p>
<p>You’ll then be given the option to choose which Facebook page (if you manage multiple pages) and which post you’d like to boost.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1340" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-7.53.43-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 7.53.43 AM" width="498" height="276" /></p>
<p>Next you are given the option to name your Campaign which is the highest level organizer in Facebook for your ads. A good option here is to replace the name that Facebook gives your campaign with the specific quiz you are working with. That way you can keep track on your Facebook boost success from the management page a lot more easily.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Target like a pro</strong></p>
<p>Once that’s done, you’ll be given all the targeting options (see below) which is where the magic happens. You can choose location targeting by country, region, state, city, etc. Or you can target by age, gender, language, interests, behaviors, and connections to your page or to fans of your page. This is also where you’ll be able to set a budget, timeframe for your promotion, and get an idea of the audience size you’ll be targeting. It can feel a little overwhelming at first, but remember, you can always just delete it. And you can’t screw anything up too badly from here, so take a deep breath and let’s go.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1341" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-7.56.12-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 7.56.12 AM" width="634" height="406" /></p>
<p>When you make a quiz, think about <strong>your quiz topic</strong> and think about <strong>your target customer/user</strong>. Facebook allows for so many targeting options that it’s important you remember both of these groups while setting up your targeting. The first thing is Locations. You can go as broad as a country or as specific as a city or zip code.</p>
<p>Next comes language. If you have an English quiz, you’ll want to call out English (ALL) in the language targeting options for Facebook. If your quiz is in any other language, simply pick that language in the targeting and you’re set. We haven&#8217;t done a lot of Age or Gender targeting unless the quiz or target customer really called for it, simply because the location and language allowed for a narrowed scope and there is a preference to let the quiz topic, title, and offer do the clarifying work.</p>
<p>Next comes Interests targeting which is where you can target Facebook users based on their interest in your quiz topic, offer, business, or anything else you can come up with. For example, if I’m selling a Breaking Bad character online and I’ve created a Breaking Bad quiz, I can target fans of Breaking Bad and Walter White. Here’s where you can do some exploring and potentially create a few different Ad Sets (<em>the level under Campaigns</em>) based on varying Interests targeting. In this section, you’ll also see potential audience size which is helpful for making sure you aren’t too narrowly focused.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1342" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-8.02.14-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 8.02.14 AM" width="564" height="165" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Set your budget</strong></p>
<p>Another fantastic part to Facebook ads has been the small amount of money you can use to get started. Setting a daily budget or a Campaign budget allows any company of any size to try it. The recommendation here is to trust in Facebook’s ability to make the most of your marketing dollars by using the Pricing optimization option of ‘Get the most engagements..’. Facebook does a great job of getting you the most bang for your buck&#8230;usually.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1343" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-02-at-8.16.31-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 8.16.31 AM" width="628" height="339" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Pick the on-screen location where your quiz will show up on people&#8217;s feeds</strong></p>
<p>Finally you get to pick where your quiz shows up. We’ve found great success by removing the Right Column ads for targeting, but everything is worth trying if you feel differently. Desktop News Feed and Mobile News Feed are the perfect place for your quiz to show up. This is where you can get an idea for what your ad will look like on Facebook (make sure your spelling is correct). Then click Publish Ad.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Most people know about quizzes because they&#8217;ve seen them on their own Facebook feeds. They consistently top the charts of the most shared pieces of content on Facebook, and it doesn&#8217;t appear to be slowing down any time soon.</p>
<p>In short, Facebook is an ideal starting point for promoting your quiz. And by using the tips laid out above, you can increase engagement at an extremely cheap price – we&#8217;ve seen rates as low as $0.01 per post engagement.</p>
<p>Having said that, the book is still being written. I&#8217;m always open to new ideas about promoting quizzes on Facebook, and here are a few more valuable resources if you’re looking to kick your Facebook marketing up a level:</p>
