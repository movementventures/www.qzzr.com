				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I learned about a secret language today.</p>
<p>Dr. Scott Baird, founder of <a href="http://griffinhill.com" target="_blank">Griffin Hill</a>, calls it the &#8220;hidden language of persuasion.&#8221; He said that a fundamental part of this language is that it is primarily about the benefits that will make <em>other</em> people&#8217;s lives better off.</p>
<p>Our Chief Qwizard, Owen Fuller, teamed up with Dr. Baird for a webinar about how to create audiences that you can then speak to by using quizzes. The also explained the process of closing as many of those leads as possible by using this hidden language.</p>
<p>When new leads come in, our impulse is to immediately start yapping about our features. But by using the hidden language of persuasion, we will speak to the benefits that potential customers can look forward to, and that will put us in a position to only talk about things <em>they</em> care about.</p>
<p>You can watch the recording of the webinar below, and you can learn more about Griffin Hill&#8217;s Integrity Sales System on <a href="http://griffinhill.com" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common question we get from people is, &#8220;What can I do with the &#8216;Description&#8217; underneath the question title when I&#8217;m making a quiz?&#8221;</p>
<p>To see what I&#8217;m talking about, take a look at the picture below:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1412" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.20.32-PM.png" alt="question description" width="600" height="453" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fun question to answer, because this might be my favorite feature in the quiz maker. I&#8217;m especially fond of uploading a picture into this section and asking a question about that image.</p>
<p>For instance, check out this question from this &#8220;<a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/can-you-beat-techradar-at-our-ultimate-smartphone-quiz--1284165" target="_blank">Can you name these classic mobile phones?</a>&#8221; quiz from TechRadar:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1413" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.16.53-PM.png" alt="mobile phone" width="600" height="599" /></p>
<p>They uploaded an image of a classic mobile phone, and the goal of the question is to see if people can name the model.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately on this question, &#8220;The Zack Morris Saved by the Bell phone&#8221; isn&#8217;t listed as an answer option.)</p>
<p>Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s another example from CollegeHumor&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6979812/quiz-game-of-thrones-or-creed-video" target="_blank">Game of Thrones Scene or Creed Music Video?</a>&#8221; quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1414" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.45.51-PM.png" alt="game of thrones creed" width="600" height="592" /></p>
<p>This quiz is so beautifully simple, and it&#8217;s everything you want out of a quiz. It&#8217;s visually appealing, easy-to-consume, and humorous.</p>
<p>Another way you can use the &#8220;Description&#8221; feature on the question title is to upload an image that contains your question. That way, you can use your own fonts and colors if you&#8217;d like. Here&#8217;s a question from Fanzz&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.fanzz.com/blog/new-england-patriot-past-present/" target="_blank">Which New England Patriot are you?</a>&#8221; quiz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1415" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.52.43-PM.png" alt="fanzz question" width="600" height="544" /></p>
<p>Thank goodness for our brilliant users who continue to amaze us with the creative ways they use Qzzr. If you have any other ideas for how to use this or any other feature on Qzzr, please let us know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Demand Metric <a href="http://www.ioninteractive.com/news/2014/6/16/new-research-shows-interactive-content-is-key-to-the-buyers-journey" target="_blank">conducted a study</a> about the state of content marketing. Here are some of the key findings*:</p>
<ul>
<li>58% of the study participants stated that “content doesn’t create enough opportunities for interaction and engagement”</li>
<li>Interactive content generates conversions moderately or very well 70% of the time, compared to just 35% for passive content</li>
<li>93% of study participants believe interactive content is effective at educating buyers</li>
<li>88% of study participants said interactive content differentiates them from their competitors</li>
</ul>
<p>Interactive content for the win, right? Well, in spite of these numbers, just 25% of the study participants rated their content as slightly or moderately interactive. It&#8217;s as if they know how powerful interactive content is, but they haven&#8217;t quite figured out how to make their own.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we teamed up with our friends at <a href="http://www.thinglink.com" target="_blank">ThingLink</a> for a webinar about two types of interactive content: videos and quizzes. Our Chief Qwizard, Owen Fuller, was joined by Alicia Reich, ThingLink&#8217;s Director of Strategic Marketing and Partnerships, and they discussed the ways interactive videos and quizzes can be used to drive engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>As an example of how interactive videos and quizzes can be used together, check out the video below. It&#8217;s an annotated version of that First Kiss video that went viral last year, and 13 seconds into it, a tag appears asking, &#8220;What is your kissing score?&#8221; If you click on it, out pops a quiz where you can find out for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://video.thinglink.com/videos/624739360520011776" width="640" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Pretty awesome, right? And there are 17 other tags that appear throughout the video, transforming the video into an interactive masterpiece.</p>
<p>For more information on why people are responding to this type of content, watch the recording below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/122683524" width="700" height="438" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the slide deck that they used during the presentation:</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46053347" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>
<p><em>* <a href="http://www.ioninteractive.com" target="_blank">ion interactive</a>, which sponsored the study, created a white paper that details all of their findings. The white paper, titled </em>&#8220;Enhancing the Buyer&#8217;s Journey: Benchmarks for Content &amp; The Buyer&#8217;s Journey,&#8221; <i>can be found <a href="http://www.ioninteractive.com/white-papers/" target="_blank">here</a>.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things about making a quiz on Qzzr is the ability to <strong>make it yours</strong>. You can customize it with your own images and colors, and you can get as creative as you want with the questions you create.</p>
<p>You can also add a profile picture that will show up at the bottom of your quiz. By default, you will get a generic profile picture that will look something like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1391" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/generic-profile-picture-300x297.png" alt="generic profile picture" width="300" height="297" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the worst thing in the world, but we know you&#8217;d probably rather see your own face or logo in that space. For instance, if you&#8217;re espnW, it makes much more sense to have this image show up <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11128656/espnw-cheering-wrong-world-cup-team" target="_blank">on the start page of your quiz</a>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1392" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/espnprofile.png" alt="espnprofile" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>To set your profile picture, log in to your account, and then click on that little circle in the top right corner. If you&#8217;ve never changed your profile picture, that circle will have your initials.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1404" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.41.03-AM.png" alt="dashboard" width="996" height="513" /></p>
<p>That will bring up a dropdown menu, and the first item on the list will be &#8220;Edit profile.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1406" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.43.21-AM.png" alt="edit profile dropdown" width="467" height="337" /></p>
<p>Once you click on &#8220;Edit profile,&#8221; it will take you to a page where you can edit your name, username, bio, site, and Twitter handle. You can add your profile picture by clicking on the camera icon.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1407" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.44.54-AM.png" alt="edit profile page" width="998" height="438" /></p>
<p>Once you click on it, you can upload a picture of your choosing. It will upload with your new picture, and then you just have to hit &#8220;SAVE CHANGES&#8221; in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1408" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.46.25-AM.png" alt="profile page with picture" width="1023" height="400" /></p>
<p><strong>Some helpful tips about choosing your profile picture</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that this will show up at the bottom of your quiz. It&#8217;s a tiny but important piece of real estate, so you will want it to look great.</p>
<p>It will show up as a perfect circle, so try to use images with even dimensions. If you want to see how your image will look as a circle, I found a quick and dirty way to figure that out. Just open up PowerPoint, and then drag your image onto one of the slides.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1401" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.24.19-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-18 at 10.24.19 AM" width="800" height="524" /></p>
<p>While your image is selected, click on the down arrow next to the &#8220;Crop&#8221; button, and that will bring up a dropdown menu. From the list of options, hover over &#8220;Mask to Shape,&#8221; then go to &#8220;Basic Shapes,&#8221; and then select the oval.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1402" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.27.13-AM.png" alt="select oval" width="800" height="523" /></p>
<p>Then, you can right click on the updated image and click on &#8220;Save as Picture.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1403 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-10.31.28-AM.png" alt="save image" width="800" height="523" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then upload this as your new profile picture in Qzzr by completing the steps laid out above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As content marketers we are drowning people in a sea of trite and lazy content. If we can’t figure out how to start making better content fast, we all risk losing our audiences. That’s the problem that <b>interactive content </b>aims to solve.</p>
<p><i>On Thursday, March 19, at 1:30am ET we are going to talk about two types of interactive content, videos and quizzes,  and how these two can be combined. <a href="http://go.qzzr.com/thinglink-qzzr-webinar/" target="_blank">You can register for it here</a>.</i></p>
<p><b>What is interactive content?</b></p>
<p>Interactive content, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/24/interactive-content-can-save-content-marketing-from-the-dark-side/">as defined by</a> ion Interactive CTO Scott Brinker, “has a participatory element to it — it’s not just passively consumed, but engages the audience in an activity.”</p>
<p>It’s not just watching a video – it’s being able to interact with it by clicking on tags containing more information. For instance, a Google Maps tag could appear containing a map of the filming location. Or, it could be an Amazon tag that gives viewers the option to buy a book about the same topic.</p>
<p>Quizzes are another hot form of interactive content. Publishers and marketers are using them in content to engage their audience and learn more about who they are. You can learn about their preferences, dislikes, and interests based on the way they answer questions on trivia or personality quizzes.</p>
<p>The fundamental element of interactive content is that it requires action on the part of the consumer. By the time he or she gets through a piece of interactive content, they will have actively engaged with the content and had more time spent than traditional passive content.</p>
<p><b>The power of interactive videos</b></p>
<p>Marketers spend hours coming up with perfect call-to-action buttons. They constantly adjust the text, size, color, and placement in an effort to boost conversions.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that your video is dynamite. It’s compelling, visually appealing, and people are clicking on that beautiful play button. What else can you do to add value to the viewing experience?</p>
<p>Interactive videos give you the option to add clickable hotspots such as text, images, video, music, and maps. They appear at various points during the video to coincide with timely content and topics happening on screen. When people interact with hotspots, they can view the embeddable content while the video pauses in the background.</p>
<p>As an example, check out the below video by <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/user/336174205005463552">Doctors Without Borders</a>. They created an interactive video tour of one of their Ebola treatment centers. The video is annotated at various points with Google maps, YouTube videos, images, text, and links.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1384" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-12.11.59-PM1.png" alt="drs without borders screen grab 1" width="568" height="356" /></p>
<p>At the 13 second mark, a clickable magnifying glass flashes onto the screen. It is accompanied by the text, “What’s inside the Ebola Treatment Centre?”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1383" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-12.14.09-PM.png" alt="drs without borders screen grab 2" width="568" height="356" /></p>
<p>When you click on it, it opens up an annotated floor plan of the Ebola Treatment Centre. There are 20 icons on the image, and when you hover over each icon, a picture or text will appear with a detailed description of each section of the building.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1385" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-12.20.26-PM.png" alt="drs without borders screen grab 3" width="568" height="356" /></p>
<p>So in 13 seconds, we just went from watching a video about the Ebola Treatment Centre to viewing its floor plan with beautiful, easy-to-use annotations. The makers of the video came up with a creative way to continue adding value after the viewer hit “play.”</p>
<p>Conclusion: As more and more people jump into the video marketing world, the novelty of merely having videos will wear off. It will get increasingly difficult to stand out in a crowded field, and so adding an element of interactivity to videos can be a game changer.</p>
<p><b>The power of quizzes</b></p>
<p>People love to find out interesting things about themselves, and quizzes are a perfect medium for feeding this craving. Whether it’s a trivia quiz about something they think they’re experts on or a personality quiz aiming to tell them <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/walking_dead_character_personality_quiz_amc-2014-10">which Walking Dead character</a> they are, people have a hard time passing up opportunities to take a peek at the metaphorical mirror.</p>
<p>Quizzes consistently top the list of the most shared pieces of content on the internet. In January,<a href="http://blog.newswhip.com/index.php/2015/02/the-biggest-facebook-publishers-of-january-2015"> 9 of the 10 most-engaged</a> stories on Facebook were quizzes. The combined number of shares for those nine quizzes was 10 million, and one quiz alone had over 1.9 million interactions.</p>
<p>And it’s not just that people are sharing and interacting with quizzes. In the process, they’re telling you all sorts of things about themselves that you would never be able find out with a static blog post. You can get insights into what topics they know or don’t know about, what preferences they have, and other personality traits.</p>
<p>Publishers and marketers have started to catch on to the viral magic of quizzes, and they are using them in a variety of ways to grow their brand and delight their audiences. Zenni Optical, for instance, <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz">created a quiz</a> with the goal of matching people with their ideal set of frames. The quiz was beautifully designed, and it contained 9 questions about personality, style preferences, and facial structure. Based on their responses, they would get an end result that was one of Zenni’s frames.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1386" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-12.23.40-PM.png" alt="zenni result" width="618" height="371" /></p>
<p>People have responded to the quiz. It was quickly taken more than 100,000 times and is now over 370,000. And it served Zenni’s goal of matching people up with a pair of their frames – they were able to generate over $250,000 in revenue off of this one quiz.</p>
<p><b>Making it all work together</b></p>
<p>So we’ve talked about two types of interactive content: videos and quizzes. Can the two be combined?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that’s what we’ll be talking about in our webinar on Thursday, March 19, at 1:30am ET. It will be a joint webinar between ThingLink and <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/">Qzzr</a>. The title of the webinar is, “Videos + Quizzes: A Match Made In Interactive Content Heaven.” Qzzr’s Owen Fuller and ThingLink’s Alicia Reich will be teaching how to fully take advantage of interactive videos and quizzes to drive increased engagement and revenue all while creating interactive content magic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m fascinated by designers. They have an ability to create something beautiful based on vague instructions such as, &#8220;make us a logo that conveys persistence and excellence—and make it blue.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1334"></span>And I didn&#8217;t realize how important a logo was for a company&#8217;s brand until I came across a car quiz and a college football quiz that put my brand knowledge to the ultimate test. In both cases, they removed the logos and branding of either the car interior or the college football uniform and asked me if I could still tell who they belonged to.</p>
<p>The first one, <a href="http://collegespun.com/pac-12/oregon-pac-12/how-well-do-you-know-cfb-uniforms-when-the-logos-are-removed" target="_blank">Can You Guess Which Cars These Debadged Interiors Belong To?</a>, was created by Car Throttle, an automotive website. They took pictures of car interiors and scrubbed out any hint of branding from the steering wheel, seats, and dashboards.</p>
<p>For instance, what car do you think this interior belongs to?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1335" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/39a0d6ad-e565-4d62-b925-c313c25ae0c4.png" alt="debadged interior" width="600" height="544" /></p>
<p>Hint: it wasn&#8217;t the Toyota MR2 (my choice).</p>
<p>The other quiz, <a href="http://collegespun.com/pac-12/oregon-pac-12/how-well-do-you-know-cfb-uniforms-when-the-logos-are-removed" target="_blank">How Well Do You Know College Football Uniforms When The Logos Are Removed?</a>, was a bit more humbling for me. I&#8217;m not an expert when it comes to car interiors, but I consider myself a fairly big college football fan.</p>
<p>I ended up doing fairly well &#8212; 12 out of 15 &#8212; but I was stunned when I missed this one:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1336" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6c1859af-fa38-4b83-bfa6-43303f8a43af.png" alt="college football" width="601" height="673" /></p>
<p>I would have bet my life that it was Oregon State when I saw it for the first time, but it was something else (I won&#8217;t spoil the answer for you). Just removing a tiny little logo from the front of the jersey, I was tricked into choosing the wrong answer. Logos can be such a small thing, but in fact, they&#8217;re <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Again, designers are amazing.</p>
<p>And these quiz creators are amazing too. As Qzzr enters its second year, our users are still coming up with brilliant ways to delight their audiences with fun, smart quizzes. There&#8217;s no shortage of quiz ideas that people are coming up with every day, and it&#8217;s an absolute pleasure to be along for the ride.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/quiz-generated-124000-revenue-counting/" target="_blank">I told you</a> about a quiz that had generated over $124,000 in revenue for an eyewear company called Zenni Optical. Here is what I said at the time:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>This quiz has been taken more than 140,000 times, but that’s not even the best part. Zenni was able to capture 7,000 email addresses, and the quiz helped generate $124,000 in revenue (<strong>and counting</strong>).</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out that quiz had A LOT of counting left to do.</p>
<p>I just talked to one of the people who helped create that quiz, and he said the quiz was still a gold mine. It has now been taken over 300,000 times, generated <strong>more than 16,000 new leads, </strong>and<strong> </strong>produced <strong>$259,496.20 in revenue</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a <strong>quarter million dollars</strong> off of one quiz.</p>
<p>You can see this quiz for yourself here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/f094ba79-35f3-4df3-90c2-bc7e502466e3.png" alt="zenni frames quiz" width="460" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>And guess what? It’s not done yet. I can’t wait to follow up with them in a couple months to get an update on how the quiz is doing.</p>
<p>Nothing makes us happier than seeing our users get out-of-this-world results with their quizzes. Whether your quiz generates over a quarter million dollars or entertains your family at a reunion, we’re here to celebrate all of your victories.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 dir="ltr"><em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This post is part of a series documenting Lucidchart&#8217;s experiment with using quizzes for B2B marketing.</span></em></h4>
<p>We’ve had a great time using Qzzr as a marketing tool and we’ve been pleased with the preliminary results. In this final post, we discuss narrowing our quiz strategy, using Qzzr to make a quiz, and our results metrics.</p>
<p><span id="more-1262"></span><b>Narrowing our focus</b></p>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.qzzr.com/b2b-marketing-online-quizzes-part-2-choosing-quiz-topics/" target="_blank">our last post</a>, we outlined our strategy to use two different sets of quizzes for this test run with Qzzr. One quiz would be aimed at our existing customers, while the other would be pushed out on Twitter to generate new leads. As we wrote the quizzes, however, we decided to focus on just one.</p>
<p>We wanted to put all our focus on the quiz aimed at existing customers, because we already have a huge volume of leads: customers who use the free version of the service but have not upgraded to paid or team accounts. So we posted the quiz to our blog, advertised it on social media, and sent out a targeted mailing to some of our many unpaid customers. We chose to target customers who had signed up for our service in the last few months, but hadn’t made a diagram yet.</p>
<p><b>Writing the quiz</b></p>
<p>Writing the quiz proved to be a challenge for our team. We wanted to find the right balance between something fun to take and something that would also be useful to our customers. Plus, since we have a very diverse userbase, we wanted to make sure our “fun” questions were broad and relatable enough to engage all kinds of people.</p>
<p>Happily, the experience of building a quiz with Qzzr wasn’t challenging at all. The interface was sleek and intuitive, and it was easy to modify questions, add pictures to each question, and write up the results sections. We were even able to add a coupon code at the end of the quiz that led to a team trial—a big plus for us, since users on a team trial are more likely to pay for Lucidchart in the future.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-auto-redirect="true" data-quiz="25263"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p><b>Reviewing results</b></p>
<p>Once we had published the quiz for a few weeks and sent out our first mailing, we were ready to look at our statistics. We had a 1% open rate for our mailing that advertised the quiz, and a 7% click through rate for those who opened the email and followed the link to the quiz.</p>
<p>Of those who took the quiz from all channels, 10% clicked on the coupon offer at the end to upgrade to a paid Lucidchart account. We were very pleased with this metric, and because of it, we’re considering a similar email campaign that would be sent to more users.</p>
<p>One thing that surprised us was that the quiz still managed to attract first-time registrations, despite the fact that our email was only sent to current customers. We are still exploring how this happened, but it seems to be a result of people finding the blog post organically and being curious enough to take it.</p>
<p>Overall, we had a great time using quizzes for marketing and the results were better than we expected. We’ll continue to experiment with this new marketing strategy to engage existing users and attract new ones. We’d like to try posting quizzes directly on our social media accounts, as well as directly to sites like Qzzr, rather than just embedding them.</p>
<p>Lucidchart has been growing rapidly. We’ve have been getting great coverage from places like <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/309297/lucidchart-replaces-visio-on-mac/">Cult of Mac</a> and other places around the web, which helps us grow the top of our funnel and register new users. We’re excited to be using innovative marketing techniques like quizzes to help convert those new users to paid accounts.</p>
