				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your best content falls in the woods, does it have any value?</p>
<p>It does you little good to create the best content on Earth if no one is going to find it. So we wanted to come up with a go-to promotion strategy for marketing quizzes and other forms of interactive content. <span id="more-1709"></span></p>
<p>We’ve taught you <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to create great content</a>, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">how to find images</a> for it, and even <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/guide-for-global-quiz-domination/" target="_blank">how to use it to take over the world</a>. So what’s the next step? Spreading the word, obviously. You’re smart, you know the basics—stick it on Facebook and Twitter, put it on your blog, send it out through your newsletter. But what about the secrets, the things that set masters apart from amateurs? Well, that’s what we’re here for. We&#8217;ve picked up a few promotion strategy tricks along the way, and would love to share them with you.</p>
<p>First, a disclaimer: depending on who your customer or market is, your promotion strategy will be different. Not everything in this post will work for everyone, so instead of offering a to-do list, we offer this list as a toolbox, letting you choose your own tools for the job at hand.</p>
<p>Now that that’s over, let us introduce you to your new go-to resources for content promotion strategy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1712 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png" alt="1" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Have awesome content</h3>
<p>The first step, albeit obvious, must be stated: promoting content rests on the prerequisite of having content that’s worth promoting. What makes that? Good ideas, eye-catching headlines, captivating images. You’re already salivating just thinking about it, we know. And if you’re planning on using a quiz or two, check out our tips on <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to make it sweet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1713 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png" alt="2" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Use who you know</h3>
<p>Take advantage of the people that already know you and like you. Not in a bad way, more in a you-liked-that-one-thing-so-let-me-show-you-something-kind-of-like-it type of way. This means any way your brand has of reaching customers, like social media, newsletters, and blogs.</p>
<p>Anywhere you have an audience that’s already shown they’re interested in what you have to say, put your content there! Since newsletter subscribers and blog viewers are fairly self-explanatory, we’ll focus mainly on how to reach your social followers. It doesn’t matter which social media platform you use most—whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, or Pinterest—something here applies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1711 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png" alt="3" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h4>Post it!</h4>
<p>Once it goes live, make sure it goes out. On sites that allow it, use hashtags that work well in your industry; you can find them using sites like <a href="hashtagify.me" target="_blank">hashtagify.me</a> and check their effectiveness with <a href="ritetag.com" target="_blank">Rite Tag</a>. Tag the inspiration for your content or anyone you feature (we’ll talk more about this later).</p>
<h4>Post it again&#8230;and again</h4>
<p>When the internet gets over 9,000 new tweets and 2,000 new Instagram photos per second, how do you get your posts noticed? The easy solution is to post more. Here’s a few tips straight out of the Qzzr playbook:</p>
<p>Twitter: On publish, 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months<br />
Facebook: On publish, 3 days, 1 week<br />
LinkedIn: On publish, 1 week<br />
Google Plus: On publish, 1 week</p>
<p>We know what you’re thinking though: what if your followers get annoyed? Guy Kawasaki doesn&#8217;t think so—in <a title="Guy Kawasaki’s 12-Part Social Media Strategy Template" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/guy-kawasaki-social-media-strategy-template/" target="_blank">a recent webinar </a>we did with him, <strong>he asserted that the potential for a few lost followers is well worth the risk</strong>.</p>
<p>However, facing that risk head-on may be more than you can handle. One trick is to present something different with each post, a tidbit that educates anyone who reads it, whether or not they click on your link. Never post the exact same thing twice. A few ways to introduce that variety:</p>
<p><strong>Tweet the title</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz (and How to Make it Viral)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pose a question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Of all the forms of content out there, why should you use quizzes and how do you make a killer one?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote an author</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to make it viral: get five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher to share it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cite a statistic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know: The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mention influencer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BuzzSumo’s Stephen Walsh paired up with Qzzr to talk quiz tactics, analytics, and stats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make a bold, attention-grabbing statement (that would double as a title)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t fall behind! How to join the content revolution with quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post a link</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post a photo</strong></p>
<h4>Time it right</h4>
<p>But what’s the use of posting and posting again if no one sees it? You have to post when the most people are online.</p>
<p>To schedule, use something like <a href="hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite </a>or <a href="www.tweetdeck.com" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a>. For ideas about optimal posting times, here’s what we’ve picked up in our adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>More posts/day = more engagement</li>
<li>Most blog post shares happen on Thursday</li>
<li>For the most Facebook clicks, post at 1:00pm or 3:00pm on Thursday or Friday—for the most shares, post Saturday afternoon</li>
<li>For Twitter, 5:00pm weekdays or anytime weekends is best</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pin it</h4>
<p>You’re probably thinking Pinterest, but you can pin posts in Twitter too (in Facebook, it’s called highlighting). This means anyone who looks at your profile will see these posts first.</p>
<h4>Feature your image</h4>
<p>Pinterest &amp; Instagram are image-based websites, but that doesn’t mean you should neglect photos on your other accounts. Facebook thinks posts with photos are more “important,” which makes them more likely to appear in newsfeeds, and a tweet with an image is much more noticeable than all-text.</p>
<p>We like using stock photos under the Creative Commons license (you can find photos <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">at these websites</a>) and then editing them using <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>.</p>
<h4>Post in groups</h4>
<p>If your business is B2B or if content is directed to a very niche community, posting to groups is essential. Find Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, and Google+ communities whose members would benefit from what you’re posting. Here at Qzzr, we usually try to find two or three groups on each website that are relevant.</p>
<h4>Expand your reach</h4>
<p>Last but not least, you can always draw more eyes by paying for views, if you’re so inclined. The great thing about this is the control you have over who you’re targeting—people who are similar to your current audience, age range, demographic, etc.</p>
<h3>Find people who want to know you</h3>
<p>If you have valuable content (and of course you do), it&#8217;ll mean something to others as well. So your job is to seek out these others and let them spread your words and images to other people in the industry as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1714 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png" alt="promotion post" width="900" height="900" /></a></p>
<h4>Bloggers &amp; influencers</h4>
<p>Find the bloggers and influencers who write about your topic and find your content valuable. But remember: someone needs a reason to read, retweet, or recommend whatever it is you send them—and sometimes, they even need a reason to open the email you send them. As Alex Turnbull, the founder of Groove, <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/1000-subscribers" target="_blank">quotes</a>, “No one cares about your content unless they care about you.”</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a catch-22: how do you make people care about your content if you don’t email them? But why would they open your emails if they don’t care about you? The secret is to start building the relationship and the conversation before you need it. Start interacting with influencers by commenting thoughtfully on their posts, retweeting their content, and then emailing them personally after they&#8217;ve seen your name and responded a few times. It’s time consuming but it’s definitely worth it.</p>
<p>You can find bloggers or influencers (people with big followings who share content similar to yours) through any of several sites. Some focus on different social platforms, and others, like BuzzSumo, are multi-purpose—you can find bloggers and Twitter influencers.</p>
<p><a href="http://BuzzSumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Topsy.com" target="_blank">Topsy.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Alltop.com" target="_blank">Alltop.com</a><br />
<a href="http://WeFollow.com" target="_blank">WeFollow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Twellow.com" target="_blank">Twellow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://CircleCount.com" target="_blank">CircleCount.com</a></p>
<h4>Blogger communities</h4>
<p>Similar but sometimes more effective (results will vary), you can also submit your article to mass communities of bloggers like:</p>
<p><a href="http://triberr.com/pages/stream.php" target="_blank">Triberr</a><br />
<a href="http://www.socialbuzzclub.com/" target="_blank">Social Buzz Club</a><br />
<a href="http://bizbloggingbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Biz Blogging Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://viralcontentbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Viral Content Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://www.justretweet.com/" target="_blank">Just Retweet</a><br />
<a href="https://izea.com/" target="_blank">Izea</a></p>
<p>Izea is a site that doesn’t really fit in this category because it functions differently. It’s a paid service where brands can find and pay social media content creators to feature their products/content. It worked well for Zenni Optical (made them <a title="The Anatomy of the Million Dollar Quiz [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/million-dollar-quiz-revenue/" target="_blank">over $1 million!</a>).</p>
<h4>Link roundups</h4>
<p>Link roundups are another way to get your content out there. Many bloggers send out daily or weekly newsletters with a list of their favorite articles or links around the web. For example, <a href="https://mattermark.com/category/mattermark-daily/">Mattermark</a> and <a href="http://foundcy.com/">Foundcy</a> do this with startup-related content. Google something like “link roundup” or “weekly link roundup” along with a category name, and email the organizer.</p>
<h4>Forums and submissions</h4>
<p>Submit post to relevant chains. Find a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">reddit</a> that’s similar to what you do. Or, if you&#8217;re in a very popular or large industry like startups or tech, you can submit to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a> for tech or <a href="http://inbound.org/">Inbound.org</a> and <a href="https://growthhackers.com/">Growth Hackers</a> for marketing. Forums are also a good niche place to send your content to—just find ones that apply to you and are made up of audiences that would find value in what you post. And just like with bloggers and influencers, it&#8217;s best to have a good standing within the group before you start posting.</p>
<h3>Put yourself out there</h3>
<p>Curation and aggregation get confused a lot. The easiest way to distinguish the two? Aggregation is usually automatic or, at least, not filtered based on any standard of quality, just amassed by keywords. Curated content is manually selected by someone and usually republished by that person with fresh insights, a new headline, or personal commentary. In other words, aggregation is collecting, while curation is choosing what&#8217;s in that collection. Both are great for submitting to to expose a wider audience to what you&#8217;re writing or making.</p>
<h4>Content curation platforms</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of popular content curation platforms across the web. (We debated keeping <a href="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis/confirm">Digg</a> on the list, but it seems to have passed its hey-day. No harm in submitting there anyways though, right?)</p>
<p><a href="stumbleupon.com" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a><br />
<a href="http://www.scoop.it/" target="_blank">Scoop.it</a><br />
<a href="http://paper.li/" target="_blank">Paper.li</a><br />
<a href="https://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a></p>
<p>The website that we&#8217;re most familiar with on the list is StumbleUpon, so we&#8217;ll stick with giving you advice on that one. First, you submit the page by logging into your StumbleUpon account. Stumblers love things like videos, tutorials, infographics, images, and lists. Interactive is even better—quizzes, anyone? If you&#8217;re serious about getting &#8220;stumbles,&#8221; add a StumbleUpon badge to your page to increase organic traffic, and share StumbleUpon&#8217;s custom URL on your social media. Lastly, you can track analytics—the views and likes on your submitted piece—by clicking on the &#8220;Your Likes&#8221; portion of your profile.</p>
<h4>Content aggregators</h4>
<p>Here are a few aggregators that cover different topics. Same as the curation platforms, most of them require you to create an account before submitting content.</p>
<p><a href="alltop.com" target="_blank">AllTop.com</a><br />
<a href="affposts.com" target="_blank">AffPosts.com</a><br />
<a href="affbuzz.com" target="_blank">AffBuzz.com</a><br />
<a href="affdaily.com" target="_blank">AffDaily.com</a></p>
<h3>Get discovered</h3>
<p>Content discovery/syndication networks are the ones that “suggest” more content from you whenever you’re on a publisher site like CNN, Time Magazine, or National Geographic. The most well-known content discovery networks are <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/">Outbrain</a> and <a href="http://taboola.com/">Taboola</a>—both of them offer analytics, allow geographical targeting, and strive to drive organic traffic.</p>
<p>The choice of what to use is yours, but here are a few general tips:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Make your page easy to share. The whole point of having your content &#8220;discovered&#8221; is the organic traffic that comes with it—along with the organic shares. Are your share buttons always visible and accessible to the user?</li>
<li>Try to get more out of every person who visits your site. Ask for, at best, an email (maybe in exchange for premium content like an ebook) or, at worst, a Facebook like or Twitter follow.</li>
<li>Build your retargeting audience. Use Google Analytics to build an audience based on the landing page for your Outbrain or Taboola campaign. This way, anyone who&#8217;s visited your site as a result of content discovery will see your ads as they continue to search the web, keeping you in their mind for the extent of their web-surfing duration.</li>
<li>Test-launch your content. You can use discovery networks to test different headlines against each other, like a soft launch or A/B testing. If you do this before a print run or making something premium content, it can save you a lot of time and money.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4>Reuse what you have</h4>
<p>Why do more work than you have to? Republish &amp; repurpose your old content that works. Make an infographic, podcast, slideshare, or—even better—a quiz! Here’s a full list of things you can turn one high-performing post into:</p>
<p>Infographic<br />
Slideshare presentation<br />
<a href="http://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">Quiz</a><br />
<a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Poll</a><br />
Guest post<br />
Webinar<br />
Ebook<br />
PDF<br />
Podcast<br />
Video<br />
Email course<br />
List</p>
<p>You can also straight republish your content on sites like Quora, LinkedIn, and Medium. Just remember to link back to your original content and make allowances to how it will affect analytics.</p>
<p>Well, that’s that! Let us know your successes or failures with any of these platforms in the comments—or if we&#8217;ve left anything major out of our content promotion strategy guide, let us know. And if you want to hear about a quiz-specific success story, learn how <a href="http://www.internetmarketinginc.com/blog/case-study-million-dollar-quiz/" target="_blank">IMI made a quiz for Zenni Optical that generated a million dollars</a>.</p>

<p>One of the three most important tricks to making a quiz is great imagery (<a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/3-tips-will-help-make-engaging-quizzes/" target="_blank">the other two being an engaging topic and eye-catching title</a>). Easy enough, right? If only that were true—landing the right pictures can be a real chore. Unfortunately, it isn’t really feasible to have an on-staff photographer for all your quizzes (as nice as that would be), but looking for images on the web means worrying about licenses and usage rights. Well let us take care of that for you! <strong>We put together an easy resource to help you easily find the best copyright-free images on the web.</strong></p>
<h4>Want a personalized recommendation? Scroll to the bottom to take our quiz!</h4>
<p>We all know about Google Images filter by usage rights, Flickr, and Getty Images. But our favorite websites are the ones with fantastic photographers, pages and pages of photos, and—of course—easy-to-use search (because no one wants to scroll past pages of landscape when what you really need is a picture of a car). There are so many great new sites with an emphasis on completely free, breathtaking photos that we just had to share them with you. <strong>(Note: Not all images are copyright-free. Some of them may require attribution, so be sure to check out the license for each site you use.)</strong></p>
<p>Have a favorite that’s not on our list? Link it in the comments and share the love.</p>
<h2>The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images</h2>
<h3>10. <a href="http://www.imcreator.com/free" target="_blank">IM Free</a></h3>
<p>Made by IMCreator, IM Free has a well-categorized inventory of thousands of stock photos. It’s loaded in the Cityscape, People, and Nature categories, but falls a little short if you need pictures for something about tech or business. Just remember that any image off this site needs attribution to the creator.</p>

<h3>9. <a href="http://negativespace.co/" target="_blank">Negative Space</a></h3>
<p>The selection is limited, but the best part of Negative Space is that you can sort by color or even copy space position (for your non-quiz stock photo needs). And if you want to try your hand at design or editing, you can download the raw file too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1611 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>8. <a href="http://magdeleine.co/browse/" target="_blank">Magdeleine</a></h3>
<p>A small collection (couple hundred) of photos to be used more for inspiration than anything. What’s special about this site is the ability to filter by dominant color.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1612 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>7. <a href="https://stocksnap.io/" target="_blank">StockSnap</a></h3>
<p>The selection on StockSnap might be a bit limited, but that’s because the two-person team curates and hand-selects each photo for a “bad ass repository of beautiful stock photography.” The layout isn’t bad either, showing you the number of views and downloads for each photo and also letting you see what’s trending on the site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1613 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>6. <a href="http://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a></h3>
<p>Pexels has over 2000 photos chosen from other stock photo sites across the internet. It’s an easy-on-the eyes site with a great selection. One downside is there’s no categorization, so trying to browse photos may get a little messy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1614 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://stockphotos.io/" target="_blank">StockPhotos.io</a></h3>
<p>If you’re a Pinterest lover, you’re in luck: StockPhoto.io’s website is almost the same. StockPhotos.io has 30,000+ photos (all searchable!), well tagged and well categorized. There’s also an illustrations board, if that’s more up your alley.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1615 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>4. <a href="http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/stock-up" target="_blank">Stock Up</a></h3>
<p>This one might be cheating a little: Stock Up consolidates 21 different copyright-free image sites, including great sites like Life of Pix and New Old Stock Photos, into one. Clean layout and easy search are a plus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1616 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>3. <a href="http://picjumbo.com/" target="_blank">PicJumbo</a></h3>
<p>It may not be the prettiest site you’ve ever seen (and definitely not the most ad-free), but the categories and tags—not to mention the sheer volume of photos—definitely make PicJumbo worth it. Also a bonus is the fact that you can see other tags on photos you’re looking at. If you’re so inclined, going premium means you can download bundles of photos.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1617 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>2. <a href="http://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a></h3>
<p>Not only does Pixabay have 380,000+ photos, it also has vectors and drawings. The categorization and search is impeccable—and you can see a photographer’s entire collection. The size selection at download is pretty nifty too. Oh, and did we mention each photo’s hand-picked for quality?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/9.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1618 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/9.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>1. <a href="http://finda.photo/" target="_blank">FindA.Photo</a></h3>
<p>Like Stock Up, FindA.Photo is also a collection site &#8211; it takes its thousands of photos from Unsplash, MMT, and Picography among others—but with a kick: browsing by HTML color code. Just type “&#8211;color #000000” (replace #000000 with the HTML code of the color you’re looking for) into the search bar. You can also <a href="http://finda.photo/search/tips#tags">search with width or height</a>, aspect ratio, or the average saturation of the image (great for finding black-and-whites.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1619 size-full" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>There you go—ten of the best copyright-free image websites on the web! But maybe ten&#8217;s too many and you can&#8217;t narrow it down. Don&#8217;t worry, Qzzr&#8217;s got you covered. Take our quiz and we&#8217;ll <em>tell</em> you which website is best for you.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="65564"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>Can’t get enough copyright-free images? Here are some sites we’ve found that’ll send you a few new ones by newsletter every week or so.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://unsplash.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=655606e77350bfa30e1ab5457&amp;id=9493051dec" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>: 10 absolutely stunning, minimalistic pictures every 10 days. Also has <a href="https://unsplash.com/">a great site</a> (albeit a somewhat limited search functionality) that FindA.Photo and others pull from.</li>
<li><a href="http://littlevisuals.co/" target="_blank">Little Visuals</a>: 7 photos every week.</li>
<li><a href="http://join.deathtothestockphoto.com/" target="_blank">Death to the Stock Photo</a>: This “coffee for the modern creative” sends photos every month.</li>
<li><a href="http://jaymantri.com/" target="_blank">Jay Mantri</a>: A designer in Santa Monica, CA who releases 7 pictures every Thursday.</li>
<li><a href="http://snapwi.us7.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b365306a53a9c7e150ae6c5e1&amp;id=492b46284e" target="_blank">Snapwire Snaps</a>: 7 hand-picked images in your inbox every 7 days.</li>
<li><a href="http://realisticshots.com/" target="_blank">Realistic Shots</a>: Another 7 photos every week for your inbox pleasure.</li>
<li><a href="http://newsletter.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a>: We mentioned Pexels above in #6, but we wanted to add their monthly newsletter to the mix too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want to pay for your stock photos, there’s a market for that too. Some of our favorites:</p>
<ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, our friends at Uberflip joined forces with us to put on a webinar titled &#8220;How to Effectively Incorporate Quizzes in Your Content Strategy.&#8221; Uberflip&#8217;s VP of Marketing Hana Abaza and our Chief Qwizard Owen Fuller talked about why quizzes are so hot, what you can use quizzes for (hint: social traffic and lead generation!), and of course, how to make your own quiz. With an average of 10% lead conversion, your content strategy template isn&#8217;t complete without a quiz.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a> and Qzzr got together to talk about quizzes, content marketing, and going viral—and how to use tools from them to do all three. Our one-hour webinar (embedded below) gave a lot of great tips and hints, but the crème de la crème had to be the six steps to creating a sweet quiz from our Chief Qwizard Owen and BuzzSumo’s Stephen Walsh.</p>
<h5><a href="http://ctt.ec/2NAdM" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Click to Tweet your thanks to Stephen!</a></h5>
<p>So we thought, why not turn those steps into a step-by-step list in a blog post so you can refer to it again and again when you make a quiz? Let us give you the meat and potatoes—and if we leave you wanting more, our webinar’s always there for a listen.</p>
<p><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1599" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Why-quizzes--300x150.png" alt="Why quizzes- 6 steps to a sweet quiz" width="484" height="242" /></p>
<p>First questions first: why are quizzes the new golden child of content marketing? Sure, they’re a form of media. But why are they more popular than, say, infographics or surveys or a plain old blog post? It’s because quizzes are engaging and nourishing. We can interact with them and—lo and behold!—they interact back. They feed us by telling us things about ourselves. As humans, we are our own favorite subjects.</p>
<p>So to all the brands, marketers, and publishers out there: make us feel good about ourselves, make us laugh, and give us something to brag about. And when you do, we’ll interact like crazy—to the tune of 82% conversion rates.</p>
<h3><strong>The 6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Do your research</h4>
<p>The best quizzes come from content that gets shares—content that resonates with its readers, spawns controversy and questions, or is easily misunderstood. So making a great quiz comes from understanding the content. Look at your old content with a fresh eye. Lists, infographics, posts with lots of comments—why can’t they be turned into quizzes?</p>
<p>This is also where BuzzSumo comes in. <a href="http://buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">Using their tool</a>, you can search topics and websites (even adding “quiz” or “?” after the terms to limit your results to quizzes) and see what’s being shared across the internet. Stephen made a great point during the webinar that recycling content for quizzes from checklists or how-to’s is incredibly easy. Get an idea of what’s out there—and how you make it even better.</p>
<h4>2. Choose your quiz</h4>
<p>There are two types of quizzes: graded and outcome. Your graded quizzes have titles like “How well do you know ___“ or “Are you a ___ expert?” and outcome quizzes are more along the lines of “Which superhero are you?” and “What color is your personality?”</p>
<p>Graded quizzes are about making people feel good about their score and educating as you go along. Assign outcomes like “You got 90%! You’re a genius!!” rather than simply “You got 90%”, and use the feedback option in Qzzr when you’re creating a quiz to throw in more interesting facts.</p>
<p>Outcome quizzes, on the other hand, need shareworthy resolutions. They should be designed with results that make people feel good and look good by helping people define themselves, invoking awe or laughter, or helping people share how they want to look to their friends.</p>
<p>Something surprisingly often overlooked in quiz creation is the importance of the title. It’s the first thing your potential quiz taker will see—so make it good. Good content always needs to have a hook, and that hook for a quiz is the title. BuzzSumo can help by showing you the most popular quizzes (hint: a lot of them have “hardest” or “ultimate” in the title).</p>
<p>We’re big on interactive content here at Qzzr, so we want to ask you: do graded quizzes or outcome quizzes sound more appealing to you? Take the poll (made with our sister tool <a href="http://www.pollcaster.com">Pollcaster</a>) and see what other people chose.</p>
<p><iframe id="mv-widget-KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" src="https://api.movementventures.com/widget/poll/KyMlw1KErzlw8z1dGeepwiYYOo9" width="500px" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h4>3. Strategize your call to action</h4>
<p>People use quizzes in content marketing for lots of reasons. So what’s yours? Are you trying to generate leads? Make a sale? Gain more newsletter subscribers? Get more traffic? Defining your reason for wanting a quiz determines the call-to-action, which in turn helps you design your quiz.</p>
<p>First, understand the persona of your audience. Use BuzzSumo to look into the space you’re targeting and find topic ideas. Always focus on what your audience cares about or what both you and your audience care about jointly—otherwise you lose them.</p>
<p>Next, define the outcomes of your quiz. Make it something that people are proud to share. And make sure your call to action, whether that’s putting in an email address or linking to another blog post, is related to that outcome.</p>
<h4>4. Make your quiz</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have a secret recipe for the perfect quiz (don’t worry—we’re working on it). But in the meantime, here are some guidelines for you to follow in your search for virality:</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something cool.</h5>
<p>Keep me engaged by asking me interesting questions (quality over quantity)</p>
<h5>&gt; Show me something meaningful. And convince me it’s meaningful.</h5>
<p>Make me feel sufficiently assessed. I won’t believe that you really know who I am or who I should be if you’ve only asked me three questions.</p>
<h5>&gt; Feed me and give me something to brag about.</h5>
<p>Give me feedback. Tell me if I’m right or wrong and then give me something else interesting. And in the outcome, tell me more about myself.</p>
<h5>&gt; Make me laugh.</h5>
<p>This quiz is a perfect example of making people laugh. We usually suggest people make positive outcomes—this quiz went the opposite direction and made the outcomes hilariously offensive. It worked—it&#8217;s been taken over 200,000 times and people love sharing their [sometimes painful] results.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="22314"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<h5>&gt; Make me an offer I can’t refuse.</h5>
<p>This ties back into the call-to-action. Basically, tell me who I am and then tell me why I want what you have to offer me, whether that’s another blog post to read, an offer or newsletter to sign up for, or a drawing to enter into.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-1600" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Make-it...-300x150.png" alt="How do you make a sweet quiz? Use these tips" width="594" height="297" /></p>
<p>Make sure to use images. We’re visual beings and we want to be shown things. Equally important, images need to be licensed to be legal for commercial use. So if you’re a bit short on pictures, you can do a Google Image search and filter using Advanced Search to only find those labeled for reuse. For more info, see our post on <a title="Qzzr Answers: Images and Qzzr" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/images-qzzr/">Images and Qzzr</a>.</p>
<h5>5. Share your quiz</h5>
<p>Now that your quiz has been made, share it with the world! Put it on your blog and social media. BuzzSumo can also help you step up your game here too. Search your topic (or even rival quizzes on your topic) and click “View Sharers” for a certain piece of content. Find the influencers with high domain authority and retweet ratios who shared those pieces and ask if they’d be interested in sharing yours too.</p>
<h5>6. Learn, adapt, and improve it</h5>
<p>The best part of using Qzzr to make a quiz is the analytics that come with it. Test different quiz titles, questions, and outcomes to see what appeals to your target customer.</p>
<p>There you go—that’s the distillation of our webinar in partnership with BuzzSumo. Good luck going viral and merry quiz-making! We’ll leave you with a few last surprising facts we learned from Stephen and Owen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher sharing something is what it takes to make it viral.</li>
<li>The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
<li>The #1 NYTimes article in 2013 was a quiz. And in case that’s not recent enough for you, nine out of ten of the most shared stories on Facebook in January 2015 were quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more great tidbits you probably didn’t know (and to hear some of Owen’s terrible puns), listen to our webinar with BuzzSumo in its entirety.</p>
