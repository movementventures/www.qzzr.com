				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For all of the fanfare with <a title="Pollcaster: Qzzr’s New Brother Provides Immersive Poll Experience" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/pollcaster-qzzr-new-poll-tool/">our Pollcaster launch last week</a>, you may not have noticed some changes to Qzzr. In our relentless pursuit to make the platform as easy-to-use and optimized as possible, we rolled out some new features. Every change is made to improve your overall quiz experience.</p>
<h3>New Qzzr Dashboard</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dashboard.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1493" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" width="1000" height="711" /></a></p>
<p>The new Dashboard makes it easier to manage and differentiate your draft and published quizzes.</p>
<h3>New Design Tab Features: Pro and Enterprise</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Design-Tab1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1500" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Design-Tab1.png" alt="Design Tab" width="1000" height="601" /></a></p>
<p>Some new features appear on the design tabs for Qzzr Pro and Qzzr for Enterprise customers.</p>
<h4>Custom Fonts</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fontbackpack.png"><img class=" wp-image-1495 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fontbackpack.png" alt="Fontbackpack" width="480" height="296" /></a> <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FontFarm.png"><img class=" wp-image-1496 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FontFarm.png" alt="FontFarm" width="480" height="250" /></a> <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FontSuit.png"><img class=" wp-image-1497 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FontSuit.png" alt="FontSuit" width="480" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>You can now add custom fonts on Qzzr. Just add a font string on the Design tab of your quiz. Support system fonts can be found here: <a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cssfontstack.com/</a>.</p>
<h4>Custom Accent Colors</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Accent1.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1498 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Accent1.png" alt="Accent1" width="480" height="607" /></a> <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Accent2.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1499 aligncenter" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Accent2.png" alt="Accent2" width="480" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>Accent colors make it possible to further customize your quiz on the start page, after selecting an answer, and on the offer at the end of your quiz.</p>
<h3>New Qzzr Learning Center</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LearningCenter-e1429546674204.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1501" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LearningCenter-e1429546674204.png" alt="LearningCenter" width="1000" height="713" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://app.qzzr.com/help" target="_blank">Learning center</a> has been updated with better search, more categories and articles, and updated screenshots and videos to teach you how to use Qzzr better.</p>
<h3>Qzzr + MailChimp: Pro and Enterprise</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MailChimp-e1429546814240.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1502" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MailChimp-e1429546814240.png" alt="MailChimp" width="1000" height="612" /></a></p>
<p>Qzzr now makes it easy to send your leads right into MailChimp without any hassle whatsoever. They will now flow right into MailChimp.</p>
<h3>Webhook and Zapier: Pro and Enterprise</h3>
<p>With webhooks, as soon as a lead is generated at the end of your quiz, we&#8217;ll send off the collected email address, their responses, score/outcome, and other quiz data to a specific URL you can set within the tool. This will allow you to integrate with your email marketing platform, marketing automation tool, or CRM. Now you can follow up instantly with your leads.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know how to use webhook and would like a method to integrate with other tools, CRMs, and more, <a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">check out Zapier</a>. Qzzr and Zapier work together to automatically export leads collected on your quiz to any of the hundreds of services included with Zapier. <a href="https://app.qzzr.com/help/49-zapier-integration" target="_blank">Take a look at this screencast</a> for more detail on Zapier integrations.</p>
<p>Any of these changes catch your eye? <a href="https://app.qzzr.com/account/signin" target="_blank">Log in to your account</a> and try them out!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 dir="ltr"><em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This post is part of a series documenting our experiment with using quizzes for B2B marketing. <a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/b2b-marketing-online-quizzes/">Last week</a> we talked about our decision to try out quizzes for our online marketing approach. This week we discuss how we built our campaign around this new technology.</span></em></h4>
<p>At Lucidchart we live and breathe diagrams. Our company operates under a SaaS model targeting different personas: IT/Engineering, Product Management and Design, and Business. We offer both free accounts and paid Pro subscriptions for our <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com">diagramming tool</a>. Our goal as a marketing department is to build awareness for our product and convince people to pay for the Pro version after trying it for free.</p>
<p>So we decided to create a quiz campaign with topics that would easily fit into our existing marketing funnel.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Brainstorming</h3>
<p dir="ltr">To best determine what those quizzes should be, we started with a rapid-fire brainstorming session, keeping the funnel in mind. We brainstormed ideas that would appeal to both existing and potential customers. At this stage, even silly ideas were welcomed since they helped us approach the task with an open mind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We eliminated topics by asking ourselves key questions: where in the funnel would this quiz apply? Which areas of the funnel did we want to target? We organized our brainstormed topics around the marketing funnel, then the selected topics (highlighted in red below) we thought would move customers down the funnel in clear, measurable ways. Keep in mind that rejected topics may still have potential marketing value, so it’s a good idea to save your work.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/d170bda8-e3a9-4184-bef4-5da5fdfc5d30/0?callback=close&amp;v=862&amp;s=612"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/m_dfYupK_3lbx8gxnwIfdFDDwu2CZdBS0CCYfjPKieuHFzgVTsGM09cLt5KiB3FqJi3pXsfq2GP1gwtjE2TI4fTZLcROCw9xRWC2phUkoT9USbuFCmPFSpKNOAUViIeyhg" alt="" width="NaN" height="NaN" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Product Awareness</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Our first quiz set matches up with the top of the marketing funnel. It focuses on creating awareness, interest, and consideration for our product. We decided to use “Are you an expert in…?” style quizzes that applied to diagrams, e.g. “Are you an expert in entity-relationship diagrams?” or “How well do you know flowcharts?” We are limiting this set to diagram-types that we know have a high rate of ROI, like flowcharts and org charts. These types of quizzes are popular online right now because, let’s face it, people are vain. They like to post their quiz results on social media to let everyone know how smart they are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To advertise this series of quizzes, we’ll be using targeted promoted tweets. We’ve had success with promoted tweets leading to high click-through rates before, and we’re comfortable running PPC campaigns. After they take our quiz, readers will be prompted to provide their email address for more quizzes, diagramming tips, and info about diagramming software from Lucidchart. Since anyone who clicks on the quiz is likely to be a frequent diagrammer, they’ll be more inclined to sign up.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Product Purchasing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Our second quiz set was targeted to users farther down the marketing funnel, under intent, evaluation, and purchase. We have a large base of unpaid users that we want to a.) retain and b.) eventually convert to paid users. So we are planning to send an email blast out to unpaid users with a quiz titled “What kind of diagram should I use for my next project?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">We chose this topic because it shamelessly shows off Lucidchart’s best features, including those that many users may not be aware of (e.g. <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/tour/ER_diagram_tool">ER diagrams</a>). Additionally, if the quiz taker’s answers result in a diagram type that’s included in our Pro version, we can invite them to purchase a Pro account. We’ll even have a convenient discount offer right at the end of the quiz. We are always looking to convert our users to paid subscriptions without being too pushy, and we think this is a perfect way to do that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that we’ve determined our topics and strategy, it’s time to write and post our quizzes. Depending on how things go, we may need to update our strategy or tweak our topics—so we’ll keep you posted here on our continued progress. For now, we’re excited to finally be diving into Qzzr’s software!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve recently run an experiment on Facebook with different Share Images and got some pretty significant results.</p>
<p>Here are the variations we tested:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-339 aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-10-31-at-9.15.53-AM.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-31 at 9.15.53 AM" width="618" height="439" /><span id="more-1008"></span></p>
<p>Having just an image with no text performed the worst. Only getting between 6-8% click through rates (CTR).</p>
<p>Adding text to the image boosted the CTR to about 12% CTR.</p>
<p>However, adding text AND a Call to Action increased the CTR to 22% on mobile and 28% on Desktop!</p>
<p>Of course we expect this to vary depending on the quality of the image and the title, but starting today we are implementing a new default design for share images.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Wallpapers-Of-Albert-Einstein.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-341 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Wallpapers-Of-Albert-Einstein-1024x576.jpg" alt="100th Anniversary Of Einstein's Theory of Relativity" width="614" height="346" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;ve bolded the text and added a contrasting red button at the bottom.  We will be continuing to try and beat this share image design and we encourage you to as well!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the quiz settings we are adding the ability for you to customize the share image. It can now be different than your background image, and you can either remove our text or customize it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-8.59.47-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-342 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-8.59.47-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-06 at 8.59.47 AM" width="247" height="317" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;d love to hear your feedback on this feature, and we hope you enjoy all the additional traffic you&#8217;ll be getting!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We asked you guys what you wanted us to build for you while we were Hawaii. We had an amazing response to our quiz:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.07.33-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-291 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.07.33-AM-1024x482.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.07.33 AM" width="717" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>The top two most requested features were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change Quiz/Question type on the fly</li>
<li>Image cropping tools</li>
</ul>
<p>The team worked really hard (with some surf breaks in between) to get these features done during our Hawaiian hackathon. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of the new stuff!</p>
<p><strong>Change Quiz/Question type on the fly</strong></p>
<p>Ever select the wrong question type and then have to delete the question and recreate it? We&#8217;ll now you can easily switch the question type after you have created it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.28.21-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-294 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.28.21-AM-1024x754.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.28.21 AM" width="717" height="528" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Same thing goes for switching the quiz type. If you made a graded quiz by accident and then decide it was supposed to be an outcome quiz, you can switch the quiz type in the settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.33.00-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-295 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.33.00-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.33.00 AM" width="524" height="262" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Image cropping</strong></p>
<p>You can now crop your images right in the Qzzr quiz maker. Just go ahead and upload an image as you&#8217;ve always done. We&#8217;ll do a default crop on it, but if you want to change the way that it is cropped, just hover over the image to show the crop icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.02.53-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-292 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.02.53-AM-1024x744.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.02.53 AM" width="717" height="521" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will launch the crop window. See below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.03.28-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-293 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-1.03.28-AM-1024x833.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-11 at 1.03.28 AM" width="717" height="583" /></a></p>
<p>This works on question images, answer images, and the background image as well!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how to use quizzes to get likes on Facebook.</p>
<p>1. If you have a Pro or Enterprise plan, go to Settings and select &#8220;Edit messaging &amp; form&#8221; underneath &#8220;Leads &amp; Offers.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-5.49.31-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-280 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-5.49.31-PM-820x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-12 at 5.49.31 PM" width="574" height="717" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, set your offer title, add a description, and paste in the URL for your Facebook page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-5.50.38-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-281 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-5.50.38-PM-946x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-12 at 5.50.38 PM" width="662" height="717" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s pretty much it! Now at the end of your quiz, users will be prompted to like your Facebook page!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-5.50.48-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-282 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-5.50.48-PM-946x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-12 at 5.50.48 PM" width="662" height="717" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Happy Quizzing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Man, we are <strong>so excited</strong> to be releasing this feature. Not only has it been requested by a ton of our customers, we have very good reason to believe it will increase the share rates on your quizzes!</p>
<p>The share rates on graded quizzes have been  lower than on outcome quizzes. We hope by letting you add custom result titles, descriptions, and result images to specific score ranges will make for a much more compelling reason for people to share!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p>1. Create a graded quiz and click &#8216;Define Results&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-270" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults1-1024x604.png" alt="gradedresults1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Add your results and define the score buckets. You can do that by dragging the handles to define the range or dragging from the middle to move the range to another score.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-271" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults2.png" alt="gradedresults2" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You&#8217;ll notice in my quiz there is a 50 percent gap between the lowest result and the next highest. You can define a &#8216;Catch-all result&#8217; to fill in anywhere you don&#8217;t have score defined.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults3.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-272" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults3.png" alt="gradedresults3" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Depending on what score the user receives at the end, they&#8217;ll be given the coinciding result!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-273" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gradedresults4.png" alt="gradedresults4" /></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we released a couple of features to help people find and take more quizzes and increase the quiz share rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Retake</li>
<li>Take another quiz</li>
<li>Share Suggestion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retake</strong></p>
<p>We added a button at the end of the quiz so that people can easily try for another score or outcome. We feel like people that get a favorable outcome or score are more likely to share their result.  If you&#8217;ve already taken a quiz we display your previous result on the start page and it  links to the result page so you can share it later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-1.56.00-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-253 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-1.56.00-PM-687x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-22 at 1.56.00 PM" width="330" height="491" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-1.54.24-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-251 aligncenter" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-1.54.24-PM-911x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-22 at 1.54.24 PM" width="547" height="614" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Take another quiz:</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of the results page on Free, Standard, and Plus plans we are displaying other quizzes for people to take. Initially these are just randomly selected based on our most popular quizzes. Eventually these will be more based on user behavior and related to the quiz they just took.</p>

<p>At the end of the quiz (on desktop only) we will pop up a  window to suggest that the user share the quiz if they haven&#8217;t already shared. The trigger for displaying this is if the user a) mouses out of the quiz or b) a few seconds after not scrolling.</p>
