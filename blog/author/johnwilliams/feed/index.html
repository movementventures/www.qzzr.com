				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to create a quiz but not sure where to start? If you have a valid public library card, pull it out and head on over to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://worldbookonline.com/" target="_blank">WorldBookOnline.com</a></span>. Here you&#8217;ll find a wealth of knowledge and plenty of facts and inspiration to get you started.</p>
<p>What is World Book Online? It&#8217;s the online version of the famous World Book Encyclopedia. World Book Incorporated was founded in 1915 with its first encyclopedia published in 1917. In the 100 years since, World Book has evolved. Today, it publishes both print and digital content.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1333" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/World_Book_Encyclopedia_1990.jpg" alt="World_Book_Encyclopedia,_1990" width="800" height="449" /></p>
<p>Many public library systems subscribe to World Book Online. If yours does, you will be able to access the World Book Online website either via a link provided by your library or directly. Either way, you&#8217;ll need to enter your library card number in order to access the content. The World Book Online site currently has five World Book Products you can use as inspiration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>Early World of Learning</li>
<li>For Kids</li>
<li>Info Finder</li>
<li>Enciclopedia Estudiantil Hallazgos</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a quiz, use Timelines, For Kids and Info Finder. They&#8217;re all fantastic resources!</p>
<p><strong>Timelines</strong> &#8211; This one is broken into eight main categories: Arts, Literature, Notable People, Parts of the World, Science and Technology, Society and Culture, Sports, and World History. Start by clicking a category that interests you and then work your way through the various subcategories.</p>
<p>For example, under Notable People, you&#8217;ll be presented with more options such as Explorers, Inventors, and Notable Americans (among others). If you click Notable Americans, you&#8217;ll then be presented with a page full of notable Americans such as Mark Twain, George Washington, and John Glenn. After clicking a topic, you&#8217;ll then be presented with a timeline that displays key facts about that topic in chronological order.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic resource for factual quizzes based on events or people. For example, if your quiz is about John Glenn, you&#8217;ll find plenty of interesting information on his World Book Timeline. For instance, here&#8217;s a question you could use: How old was John Glenn on his last space flight? (Answer 77).</p>
<p><strong>For Kids</strong> &#8211; Though designed for kids, this section is also loaded with interesting information. The information in the For Kids section is highly simplified, making it easy to quickly scan and digest. Topics in this section include: People, Sports and Hobbies, Places, Arts, World Religions, Science and Mathematics, Plants and Animals, and History and Government.</p>
<p>Depending on the topic, you may find additional subtopics. For example, under World Religions there are: Books, Buildings, Customs and Beliefs, Festivals and Holidays, Greek Mythology, People, and Roman Mythology.</p>
<p>By exploring various topics and subtopics in the For Kids section, not only might you find interesting facts for a factual quiz, you may find inspiration for other quizzes down the road. For example, did you know that Cupid, the god of love in Roman stories, is believed to be the son of the goddess Venus? How&#8217;s that for an unusual quiz question this Valentine&#8217;s Day?</p>
<p><strong>Info Finder</strong> &#8211; Info Finder comes with its own Search bar, making it the go-to choice for finding information on virtually any topic. However, it&#8217;s more than just a search engine. Info Finder has several sections, each of which could be a launching spot for more research. These sections include: World Newspapers, Current Events, Interactive Earth, Science Projects, and Biography Center. It also has a featured science project and a featured biography. You can also search by: A-Z, subject, images and videos, or dictionary. Finally, you might want to check out one of the &#8220;virtual tours&#8221; offered on Info Finder.</p>
<p>Info Finder is an excellent choice when you know what you want to write about but aren&#8217;t quite sure of your facts. For example, if you know you want to write a quiz about volcanoes, go to Info Finder and enter Volcanoes in the search bar. Immediately you&#8217;ll be presented with results including general information about volcanoes as well as specific information about famous volcanoes around the world including Krakatau, Kilauea, and the mud volcanoes of Azerbaijan. Then, you will discover fascinating facts such as this one: scientists believe that the eruption of the Toba volcano about 74,000 years ago reduced Earth&#8217;s human population to just a few thousand.</p>
<p>If you want to create a factual quiz, you&#8217;ll need plenty of actual facts. World Book Online offers a wealth of knowledge and inspiration. Whether you know exactly what you want to create your quiz around or don&#8217;t have a clue, World Book&#8217;s Timelines, For Kids, or Info Finder will help you find the right facts to build a factual quiz on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good rule to live by is to spend at least three hours promoting for every hour spent creating. So if it took you two hours to create your quiz, spend six hours promoting it.</p>
<p>So how should you promote your quizzes to increase website traffic? Start with these three ideas:</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">1. Write a Blog Post Around Your Quiz</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve worked hard on creating an engaging quiz. Make sure your blog readers know about it (and increase website traffic) by embedding your quiz in a blog post. This doesn&#8217;t mean you have to write an in-depth behind-the-scenes post explaining how you created the quiz. All you need is a catchy title, a short introduction, and the quiz&#8217;s embed code. If you intend to use quizzes regularly, create a quiz category and quiz tag and then categorize and tag your quiz post accordingly. This will organize your quizzes for future reference on your blog.</p>
<p>Once published, share your blog post on your favorite social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. If you have the budget, consider using Pay Per Click ads to drive traffic to the blog post.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Boost Your Quiz Post on Facebook</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1310" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-19-at-2.58.06-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-19 at 2.58.06 PM" width="700" height="518" /></p>
<p>Facebook ads are a great way to ensure that your most important posts get seen by the right people. You have several options available including &#8220;boosting&#8221; an individual Facebook post so that more people see it (as seen above), and you can promote your Facebook page in general to get more likes.</p>
<p>Facebook ads have a lot going for them including the ability to precisely target who your ads are shown to. For example, if your &#8220;Bridezilla or Blushing Bride&#8221; quiz is targeted toward 20- to 30-year-old recently engaged women, you could create an audience for your boosted ad consisting of 20- to 30-year-old women who are engaged. Thus, you won&#8217;t waste your advertising dollars on people who are unlikely to be interested in taking your quiz. Since your ad is shown to the specific demographic your quiz appeals to, you can expect much higher engagement than if your ad were to be shown to a general audience.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Use a QR Code to Encourage Offline Users to Take Your Quiz </strong></p>
<p>If you have both a physical and digital location, consider using QR codes to entice offline prospects to take your quiz. Use a QR code generator to create a printable QR code that jumps directly to your quiz page. From there, you can print display signs encouraging users to take the quiz on their smartphones by scanning the QR code. You could also include the QR code in advertisements, invoices, receipts, coupons, flyers, trade show handouts, and on any other printed materials.</p>
<p>As quiz takers complete and share your quiz, it should continue to get additional exposure. That&#8217;s the power of creating viral content. However, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to continue promoting your quiz to keep the momentum going. With that in mind, you may want to continue your promotional efforts or expand into other areas such as Twitter or Tumblr.</p>
<p>Those are three simple ways to get more eyeballs on your quizzes. We&#8217;re always eager to hear about more ideas for promoting quizzes, so please send them our way if you don&#8217;t see yours above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online quizzes are a form of content marketing that can be used in several ways. For example, brands like Mashable, Yahoo!, ESPN, and Reddit use Qzzr to drive social traffic, grow their audiences, engage users, generate qualified leads, drive awareness, and more.</p>
<p>While these companies presumably have the resources to create and manage successful quiz marketing campaigns, what about the little guy? Is quiz content marketing a good strategy for solo professionals and small businesses?</p>
<p><strong>You bet it is.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1305 size-full" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-17-at-11.31.15-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-17 at 11.31.15 PM" width="600" height="374" /></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need a huge budget or large platform to take advantage of this popular and increasingly important marketing tool. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about incorporating quizzes into your small business&#8217;s marketing plan.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use Online Quizzes as a Marketing Tool?</strong></p>
<p>Not only are online quizzes popular and potentially viral, they&#8217;re also a great choice for small business marketing for the following four reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Little to no cost to get started</strong> &#8211; As a small business owner, you likely have a modest marketing budget &#8212; and it may already be stretched to its limits. Fortunately, you can add quizzes to your content marketing strategy for free. A free Qzzr account, for example, comes with unlimited quizzes, unlimited completions, unlimited shares, full analytics, and more. If want more features, such as lead capture and reduced branding, you could opt for a Pro account, which is just under $300 per year.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to use</strong> &#8211; Many content marketing ideas, though effective, require a great deal of time and brainpower. In contrast, creating a short quiz can be easy and intuitive. There isn&#8217;t a huge learning curve, and you don&#8217;t have to have any design or coding skills.</p>
<p><strong>Fun to create</strong> &#8211; Unlike corporate white papers or technical spec sheets, online quizzes tend to be a lot of fun to create. This is your chance to put your creativity to use and interact with your target audience on a different level.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile campaigns</strong> &#8211; In addition to engaging your audience, online quizzes can be used to generate leads, drive traffic, or present special offers. You can even edit your offer after the fact.</p>
<p>For example, you could first create a quiz and use it to drive traffic to your blog or a social media site. As your marketing needs change, you may later decide you&#8217;d like to use that quiz to collect email addresses or present a special offer for the people that complete your quiz. If that&#8217;s the case, simply edit your quiz by clicking on the gear icon, and choose &#8220;Edit offer &amp; email capture settings.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, since you can create unlimited quizzes (and since they&#8217;re both easy and fun to make), you might leave your original quiz alone and create a second one to achieve your desired outcome. In fact, you may want to create multiple quizzes, each with its own purpose. We&#8217;re not going to stop you from making as many quizzes as you want.</p>
<p><strong>Quiz Content Marketing Planning</strong><br />
In order to get the most out of your online quizzes, it&#8217;s smart to create a plan. That way, you won&#8217;t be leaving your quiz marketing to chance. Start by determining the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What marketing outcome do you want quizzes to deliver: more traffic, more leads, or more engagement? There&#8217;s no right or wrong answer. In fact, you can choose all three and rotate your way through the list. However, you should know what your ultimate purpose for each quiz is as this may drive your approach.</li>
<li>Who will be taking your quizzes? In a perfect world, this will be your ideal customers and prospects. If you have marketing personas already developed, use them in conjunction with your quiz campaigns.</li>
<li>What topics are of interest to your target audience? Once you know who you&#8217;re writing a quiz for, you&#8217;ll be in a much better position to choose topics of interest. For example, quiz topics for 19- to 22-year-old male snowboarders will be quite different from quiz topics for 54-year-old female divorcées.</li>
<li>How often will you publish quizzes? Again, there&#8217;s no right or wrong answer here, but you&#8217;ll want to choose a realistic schedule both for you, the content creator, and your audience. Where several new quizzes per day might be perfect for a large site like BuzzFeed, it may be too much for a smaller company &#8212; and its audience &#8212; to handle.</li>
<li>Where will you publish them? Online quizzes can be embedded on your website or blog, and they can be shared across social media. Your marketing goals and existing traffic patterns will come into play here. For example, if your goal is to generate leads from blog visitors, then embedding an online quiz on your blog makes sense. On the other hand, if you want to drive traffic to your blog, it may make more sense to share it on Facebook and spend a little money to boost the post.</li>
<li>How will you let your target audience know about a new quiz? As with many online marketing techniques, building a quiz is not necessarily a case of &#8220;build it and they will come.&#8221; You may also need to publicize your quiz in some way such as by boosting your post on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big brands are using online quizzes to grow their lists, drive traffic, generate leads, and engage their audiences &#8212; and small businesses can do the same. Regardless of where you&#8217;re at in your growth stage, there&#8217;s a quiz out there that&#8217;s begging to be written by you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the reasons marketing quizzes have become popular has to do with the human tendency to show off. After all, it&#8217;s human nature to want to show others just how smart we are &#8212; and online trivia quizzes are the perfect way to do just that. They&#8217;re fun; they&#8217;re on interesting topics; and they&#8217;re relatively easy to create on platforms such as QZZR. Creating a trivia quiz is a fantastic way to let your quiz takers shine, and the possibilities are virtually unlimited.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How to Create a Trivia Quiz</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Creating an online trivia quiz involves just a few steps:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Pick a topic</li>
<li class="p1">Align the topic to your audience&#8217;s interests</li>
<li class="p1">Do research</li>
<li class="p1">Create</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For some, topics for online trivia quizzes come easy. For others, that&#8217;s the hardest part. Below are a few popular ideas for trivia quiz topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Celebrities</li>
<li class="p1">Movies, TV shows, and pop culture</li>
<li class="p1">Fictional characters such as Harry Potter</li>
<li class="p1">Song lyrics</li>
<li class="p1">World War II trivia</li>
<li class="p1">Animals</li>
<li class="p1">History</li>
<li class="p1">Science</li>
<li class="p1">Vocabulary</li>
<li class="p1">Famous authors such as JRR Tolkien</li>
<li class="p1">Olympics</li>
<li class="p1">Sports</li>
<li class="p1">Myths</li>
<li class="p1">Religion</li>
<li class="p1">Geography</li>
<li class="p1">Criminals</li>
<li class="p1">Famous men and women</li>
<li class="p1">Famous quotes</li>
<li class="p1">Geography</li>
<li class="p1">Current events</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Virtually any of the topics above can be tailored to best meet your target audience&#8217;s interests. For example, if your target audience includes older men and women, you could create a pop culture quiz focused on celebrities or movies from the 1950s or 1960s. On the other hand, if your audience is made up of millennials, your pop culture quiz would be more effective if it is focused on current celebrities or movies. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Of course, if you can stoke the nostalgic flame that is in just about everyone, you&#8217;ve got a winner on your hand. For instance, check out this quiz about album covers from the 90s:</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="24001"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyone who came of age during the 90s will have a hard time resisting that one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aligning your trivia quiz to your audience&#8217;s interests is crucial if you want to get some engagement. Ideally, the quiz will also be relevant to your business or offer. For example, if you sell camping equipment, a movie trivia quiz centered on funny camping scenes could be effective. Try to find trivia topics that appeal to both your target audience and your company&#8217;s culture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you have a topic, writing the quiz is a simple matter of finding interesting trivia and entering your questions and answers into Qzzr. It can be fairly easy if you&#8217;ve done your homework, and fortunately there are a wealth of resources available online. For example, if you&#8217;re creating a trivia quiz on a famous actor or movie, <a href="http://imdb.com"><span class="s3">IMDB.com</span></a> is filled with fun facts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quick Trivia Question: Who played the President of the United States in the film <i>Canadian Bacon</i>? Quick Answer: Alan Alda.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guess how long it took to research and write that particular question? Less than a minute.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, create your trivia quiz in Qzzr. To make your trivia quizzes even more engaging, use plenty of images and animated gifs in addition to the text.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Creating trivia quizzes is a fun way to interact with your audience, and it gives people the opportunity to shine. When they do well or receive a share-worthy outcome, not only will they feel good about the experience, they&#8217;ll also want to share their quiz results via social media. After all, we&#8217;re all show-offs.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quizzes have become a useful marketing tool thanks to their popularity, potential to go viral, and built-in lead generation components. One of the challenges with quiz creation is coming up with content that resonates with your target audience. How do you overcome that challenge? Use your <strong>marketing personas</strong> as a guide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is a Marketing Persona?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketing personas are fictional characters that represent your ideal customers. Let&#8217;s say you sell art supplies and have two types of ideal customers with different attributes: stay-at-home moms ages 22-35 with a household income of less than $45,000 and 40- to 65-year-old female artists with incomes of $75,000 or more. Though both are female, they have different lifestyles, problems, needs, and concerns. They probably also take different types of quizzes online. For marketing in general, you could benefit by creating two marketing personas for these different customer segments. You could also use your marketing personas as a guide when creating quizzes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this example, we&#8217;ll use personas named Hannah Homemaker and Creative Christine. As a stay-at-home mom, Hannah obviously has kids. Thus, she likely has all kinds of problems, wants, and desires related to family. Christine is a bit older. Her child-rearing years may be over, and she&#8217;s moved into a phase of her life where she is exploring her artistic freedom. Her problems, wants, and desires are likely different than Hannah&#8217;s. Where Hannah is more arts-and-craftsy, Christine is a serious artist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketing personas help you to gain clarity about your customers, and this will help you craft messages that will resonate with them. Knowing what you know about Hannah Homemaker and Creative Christine, which persona would be more likely to be interested in a coupon for tempera paint? Which would be more interested in weekend oil painting workshops? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can approach using marketing personas with quizzes in two ways: create a quiz around multiple personas or create individual quizzes for each persona. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Using Multiple Marketing Personas with Quizzes</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have three or more personas, it may make sense to create a quiz that identifies each persona in its results. For example, a quiz titled, &#8220;What kind of artist are you?&#8221; could lead to results that perfectly describe Hannah Homemaker, Creative Christine, Serious Sculptor Sandy, and any other personas you have developed for your business. With this type of quiz, work your way backward by first defining your results (which are your personas). When writing the quiz questions, make sure that you have one response for each persona. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, a question such as &#8220;Your idea of a masterpiece is&#8230;&#8221; should have an answer from each marketing persona such as &#8220;Coloring inside the lines for the first time&#8221; (Hannah Homemaker) and &#8220;An inspired piece that <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-547" src="http://blog.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-9.49.23-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 9.49.23 AM" width="450" height="546" /><br />
took on a life of its own&#8221; (Creative Christine). Since you have both your marketing personas and your quiz results already defined, writing and answering quiz questions becomes much easier. After all, you know where you are going with the quiz.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These types of quizzes are good for making special offers based on the quiz outcome as well as for encouraging quiz takers to share their results on Facebook.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Creating a Quiz for a Specific Marketing Persona</b>  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another approach is to write separate quizzes for each persona. In our example, we&#8217;ve already determined that Hannah and Christine are both interested in art but from very different perspectives. Hannah&#8217;s interest comes from a mom&#8217;s perspective. She enjoys doing art projects with her kids and uses crafts as a means of saving money on gifts. Christine is much more serious about her art. She studies and appreciates the art of others and invests in art lessons and quality art supplies to further her own abilities. Where Hannah would love a quiz titled &#8220;How crafty are you?&#8221; Christine would likely pass. However, she&#8217;d probably be interested in something like &#8220;Which Dutch master are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this case, creating separate quizzes allows you to appeal directly to individual market segments. This is a fantastic choice for building segmented email marketing lists, too. Instead of collecting the leads into a general list, you could segment them based on the quizzes they take. If someone takes your &#8220;How crafty are you quiz?&#8221; and opts into your list, what does that tell you about that person? It tells you that the quiz taker may be more of a Hannah Homemaker than a Creative Christine. Thus, she&#8217;d be more likely to cash in your coupon for tempera paint when you send her your newsletter. Meanwhile, you&#8217;d have a separate list of Creative Christines who would be more likely to sign up for your weekend art retreats or buy expensive paintbrushes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aligning your quizzes with marketing personas helps you to connect with your targeted audience, send the right message, and segment your marketing list.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes, what we typically refer to as “the holidays” are over. Shopping malls are no longer cathedrals of Christmas jolly at every turn, and you don’t have to hear the same 10 holiday songs every where you go.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if you look at your calendar, next Monday is technically a holiday<i>: </i>Martin Luther King Day. Then, in about a month, we’ll be celebrating Valentine’s Day. And don’t even get me started on Pi/Pie Day (March 14, or 3/14… get it?), National Doughnut Day (June 5), or National Dog Day (August 25).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most people enjoy celebrating holidays. Not only are they meaningful, holidays usually involve time off from work and time with loved ones. Plus, they&#8217;re a lot of fun. Creating holiday quizzes is a fantastic way to engage with your target audience. Better still, holiday quizzes have the potential to go viral as people get into the spirit of celebrating holidays. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not sure where to start? Use the tips below to create engaging holiday quizzes. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> <b>Look beyond traditional &#8220;holidays&#8221; </b>- When we talk about creating holiday quizzes, we&#8217;re naturally talking about major holidays such as New Year&#8217;s Day, <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-535" src="http://blog.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Obstjoghurt01.jpg" alt="Obstjoghurt01" width="450" height="338" />4th of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">However, feel free to look beyond the traditional holidays. Think about annual celebrations that are relevant to your target audience such as Lost and Found Day, Frozen Yogurt Day, or Pet Safety Day. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Didn&#8217;t know these &#8220;holidays&#8221; existed? Do a quick Google search for &#8220;unusual holidays&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find all kinds of holidays that you didn&#8217;t know existed. In fact, you may want to venture into the unusual holiday realm to differentiate your holiday quizzes from the masses. While your competitors are likely creating their own Santa Claus quizzes in December, your company could stand out with a quiz that celebrates &#8220;Chocolate Covered Anything Day&#8221; (December 16th). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> <b>Create a holiday list</b> &#8211; Not all holidays will be suitable fodder for quizzes for every brand, so create your own holiday list. For example, if you run an online dating website, Valentine&#8217;s Day is an obvious choice. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the other hand, if your business sells office supplies, you might be more interested in Bosses Day or Administrative Professionals Day. Pet Safety Day is ideal for veterinary hospitals, animal rescue groups, or pet supply stores. Lipstick Day is perfect for anyone in the beauty or women&#8217;s fashion business. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> <b>Don&#8217;t wait until the last minute </b>- Waiting until January 1st<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to create and publish a quiz on New Year&#8217;s resolutions is probably a few days too late. The same is true of waiting until the 4th of July to publish your 4th of July quiz. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">People enjoy preparing for various holidays in the days leading up to them. Once the holiday comes and goes, their interest tends to wane as well. With this in mind, you&#8217;ll want to have your holiday quizzes ready to be published about a week beforehand. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In fact, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with creating a quiz months in advance and then promoting it heavily at the appointed time. One of the benefits of having your holiday quiz ready to go in advance is that your quiz can be one of the first of its type people start seeing and sharing. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> <b>Use scheduling tools </b>- Because holiday quizzes tend to have a limited shelf life, you&#8217;ll want to make sure that your quizzes appear at the right time. For example, if you want your 4th of July quiz to be seen frequently on social media starting on July 1st , use various scheduling tools to ensure that it is. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On Facebook, for example, you can preschedule posts by clicking the down arrow next to Post and choosing &#8220;Schedule Post.&#8221; Various scheduling tools are available for blogs, Twitter, and other social media sites. Depending on your preferences, you may also want to consider paid options to promote your online holiday quiz. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> <b>Use eye-catching holiday photos </b>- High quality photos set the tone for your quiz and can influence whether or not your holiday quiz is taken and shared with others. If you want your quiz to go viral, you need a good photo! Look for holiday photos on Flickr offered with the appropriate creative commons license or try a stock photography site such as Shutterstock or Fotolia. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> <b>Refresh and recycle your holiday quizzes</b> &#8211; Though holiday quizzes tend to have a short shelf life, they can be reused year after year. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While you could simply resurrect a holiday quiz once the holiday rolls around next year, we recommend doing a little editing to ensure that the quiz is current and topical. For example, if your holiday quiz features pop culture references, you may need to change your answers depending on what&#8217;s hot at the time. The same is true if it references current events.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fortunately, editing quizzes in Qzzr is super easy. Simply log into your account, find the published holiday quiz you want to edit, and then click the “Edit” icon. Make your changes, and then click the “Update” button. Since Qzzr quizzes can be embedded into blogs and webpages, any changes you make to your holiday quizzes will automatically appear regardless of where people find your quizzes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter what time of year it may be, there&#8217;s always a holiday just around the corner. Are you ready for it with a quiz? </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with just about anything that requires writing, online quiz creators frequently encounter writer&#8217;s block. Oh sure, some quizzes practically write themselves, especially once inspiration has struck. But what about those times when you want to create a quiz but your mind is a blank? When all else fails, turn to popular topics. Here are three tips that should give you a place to start when thinking about the quizzes you want to make.</p>
<p><b>Hot Topics on Facebook</b></p>
<p>Where do most of us spend way too much time? Facebook. Thus, what&#8217;s popular on Facebook is likely to be a good choice for a quiz. Let&#8217;s start with a broad overview, which may be enough to get you started.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://blog.klout.com/2014/05/topics-that-get-a-reaction/" target="_blank">a study by Klout</a>, the hottest topics on Facebook are:</p>
<p>1. Music</p>
<p>2. Television</p>
<p>3. Holidays</p>
<p>4. Software</p>
<p>5. Religion</p>
<p>6. Celebrities</p>
<p>7. Film</p>
<p>8. Books</p>
<p>9. Business</p>
<p>10. Food</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an idea: write down each of those topics on a slip of paper and pull one out of the hat whenever you&#8217;re faced with writer&#8217;s block. Once you have a broad topic, you&#8217;ll instantly be more focused. For example, instead of drawing a blank, you&#8217;ll now have a basic direction.</p>
<p>So if you pull out &#8220;holidays,&#8221; for example, you can think about what holidays are coming up. You can even think about ones that aren&#8217;t for another month or so to get you a head start.</p>
<p><b>Google Trends</b></p>
<p>Google Trends can tell you exactly what people are searching for. For instance, check out the below chart, which documents interest in the term &#8220;national championship&#8221; over time. At the time of this writing, we&#8217;re just a couple days away from Oregon taking on Ohio State in college football&#8217;s national championship. Interest in that term always spikes in January, but notice that it&#8217;s particularly high this year, probably because of the revamped playoff system that went into effect this year.</p>
<p>Clearly, the change in format struck a major chord with the world, and a &#8220;Who said it: Urban Meyer or Mark Helfrich?&#8221; quiz might be in order (for those not well-versed in college football, Meyer and Helfrich are the respective coaches for Ohio State and Oregon).</p>
<p><script src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=national+championship&amp;tz&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=600&amp;h=330" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
<p><b>Trending Topics on Twitter </b></p>
<p>With its real-time nature, Twitter&#8217;s trending topics will tell you what&#8217;s popular right now. While some hashtags and topics may not make much sense at first glance, a little digging will tell you what you need to know.</p>
<p>For instance, right now, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Scorpion%20King%204%22&amp;src=tren" target="_blank">Scorpion King 4</a> is a worldwide trending topic at the time of this writing. I had no idea that there were <em>three</em> other Scorpion King movies, so I had to click on that to see why it was trending. Apparently a trailer just came out for the film, and many people had the same reaction I did: <em>There&#8217;s going to be a Scorpion King 4???</em></p>
<p>Obviously, people are getting a kick out of this tidbit. I smell a good quiz that you could piggyback off of this: &#8220;Which Scorpion King movie should you watch tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Get it done</strong></p>
<p>Writer&#8217;s block strikes us all from time to time, but there&#8217;s no reason to let a blank page stop you from creating an engaging online quiz. So, pick a trending topic, log into your Qzzr account, click the Create button, and start creating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here we are, facing yet another New Year complete with resolutions and marketing plans. If using marketing quizzes are part of your plans for 2015, we <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-519" src="http://blog.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tumblr_ndyvjqSFM21tubinno1_1280-1.jpg" alt="tumblr_ndyvjqSFM21tubinno1_1280 (1)" width="400" height="267" />recommend creating a quiz marketing plan right now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don&#8217;t worry, it doesn&#8217;t have to be elaborate. However, a little planning now can help make marketing with viral quizzes easier and more effective. Use the tips below to start planning your quiz content creation strategy for 2015.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Big Picture</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Summarize what you want to accomplish with your quizzes for 2015. For example, will you be using quizzes strictly for lead generation or are you more interested in increasing engagement? There&#8217;s no right or wrong answer &#8212; it all depends on what you&#8217;re trying to achieve. But you should be clear on what you want to accomplish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Your Ideal Quiz User</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, define your ideal quiz user. Who do you want to reach with your quizzes? Your ideal quiz users will likely be identical to your existing (assuming you have them) marketing personas. If you do not have marketing personas, now&#8217;s the time to define them. After all, your ideal quiz users will drive virtually everything else you do, including quiz topics and where you&#8217;ll embed, share, and promote your quizzes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Your Quiz Plan</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that you know the marketing purpose and target audience for your online quizzes, it&#8217;s time to come up with a plan for the year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example:  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> How often do you want to publish new quizzes? Weekly? Monthly? Quarterly? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> What general categories (such as pop culture, fitness, or business) will your quizzes cover?  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> What specific topics will you cover within each broader category? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> What types of incentives will you offer to entice people to take your quiz? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> What types of offers and calls to action will you include at the end of the quiz? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The answers to these questions should align with your marketing purpose and target audience. For example, if you plan on using online quizzes for lead generation, your calls to action at the end of a quiz would involve some sort of opt-in form or giveaway. Likewise, if your target audience is made up of geeky millennials who love pop culture, your quiz topics will be much different than if your target audience consists of CEOs of financial services companies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Your Quiz Content Calendar</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you have clarified your intentions, understand your target audience, and have a general quiz marketing plan that includes quiz frequency and categories, it&#8217;s time to start brainstorming topic ideas and plotting out a quiz content calendar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketers often use content calendars to plan their blog and social media posts. Why not use a content calendar to plan your quizzes, too? If you have an existing content calendar for blogging and social media, adding quizzes to the mix can help ensure that your quizzes follow the same monthly theme and/or support your other posts. If you&#8217;re focused only on quizzes, that&#8217;s fine too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Start with a basic listing of each month such as: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>January</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 1 </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 2 </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 3 </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 4 </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>February</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 1 </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 2 </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 3 </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 4 </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The example above assumes a frequency of four quizzes per month, but you can adjust your calendar as desired. Once you have the basic calendar in place, look at your broad category list. Let&#8217;s say you have four main categories: Movies, Books, Food, and Nostalgia.  One approach is to rotate through your categories. In our example, your calendar would start to look something like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>January</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 1 &#8211; Movies </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 2 &#8211; Books </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 3 &#8211; Food </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 4 &#8211; Nostalgia </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>February</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 1 &#8211; Movies </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 2 &#8211; Books </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 3 &#8211; Food </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 4 &#8211; Nostalgia </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, consider any holidays or monthly/seasonal events that you may want to address with quizzes. For example, the Academy Awards is in late February. It may make sense to have an Oscars theme all month long. Likewise, Valentine&#8217;s Day may provide inspiration. Note any important events or holidays for each month. If you have preexisting monthly themes for your blog and social media posts, make sure to note those as well. This information will come in handy later when it&#8217;s time to brainstorm individual quiz topics.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#8217;s a snippet of what your quiz content calendar for January and February might look like:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>January &#8212; New Year&#8217;s Resolutions, Martin Luther King Jr.</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">1.</span><span class="s1"> Week 1 &#8211; Movies </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 2 &#8211; Books </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 3 &#8211; Food </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 4 &#8211; Nostalgia </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>February &#8212; Valentine&#8217;s Day, Presidents Day, Academy Awards</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 1 &#8211; Movies </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 2 &#8211; Books </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 3 &#8211; Food </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Week 4 &#8211; Nostalgia </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that you have your categories mapped out and have identified monthly themes, it&#8217;s time to start brainstorming ideas. Some ideas will come to you immediately based on how the categories relate to the monthly theme or holidays you&#8217;ve identified. If so, write down those ideas immediately in the appropriate section.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, when notating Martin Luther King Day for January, an idea for a quiz such as &#8220;Which Civil Rights Leader are You?&#8221; might come to mind &#8212; and it fits into your Nostalgia category. Fill in as many slots as you can based on your immediate impressions for the holidays and events while simultaneously keeping in mind your marketing purpose and target audience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While holidays and seasonal events will provide you with a good start, you&#8217;ll still need to fill in the blanks. You can go either month by month, or category by category. Either way, have fun and use your creativity to come up with quiz topics. While you certainly can fill your content calendar in one brainstorming session, don&#8217;t feel as though you must complete the full year in one sitting. Plan on revisiting your plan each month and revising and brainstorming accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Creating a quiz marketing plan for 2015 is a worthy exercise. It will help you get focused, and you&#8217;ll have an informative document that will guide your quiz creation activities throughout the year. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating your own social media quizzes is nearly as fun as taking them. Part of the fun has to do with the subject matter &#8212; such as holidays, the upcoming Academy Awards, and pop culture. As we celebrate the New Year, why not kick it off with a New Year&#8217;s quiz?</p>
<p>Where to start? The possibilities are virtually unlimited. For example, you could create a New Year&#8217;s quiz along the lines of &#8220;How well do you know your New Year&#8217;s traditions?&#8221; Or, you could go with a days-of-the-year theme such as &#8220;Real Holiday or Made Up Holiday?&#8221; Other New Year&#8217;s topics include New Year&#8217;s resolutions, New Year&#8217;s celebrations, New Year&#8217;s party types, New Year&#8217;s songs, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/quiz/your-signature-new-year-s-cocktail-is/fi9xdWl6emVzLzMwNTYy" target="_blank">New Year&#8217;s drinks</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>For instance, check out this quiz that aims to tell people how long they will keep their New Year&#8217;s Resolutions:</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="30533"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script><br />
Once you have a topic, let the New Year&#8217;s quiz creation shenanigans begin! Use the tips below to start off the New Year with a bang:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a popular quiz format</strong> &#8211; Several quiz types have proven to be popular such as &#8220;What ____ are you,&#8221; &#8220;This or That,&#8221; and &#8220;How well do you know ____&#8221; type quizzes. The quiz format will largely dictate the types of questions you ask as well as the final outcome of the quiz. We recommend choosing the quiz type and defining the outcomes (results) of the quiz before writing any questions and answers.</li>
<li><strong>Give your quiz an irresistible title</strong> &#8211; On the web, you only have a fraction of a second to make an impression. Thus, your quiz title needs to be short and snappy. Instead of &#8220;How well do you know your New Year&#8217;s traditions?&#8221; you might try &#8220;Are you a New Year&#8217;s Newbie?&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Elaborate in the quiz description field</strong> &#8211; Now that you&#8217;ve got their attention, use the quiz description field to elaborate about the quiz. The description field provides you with yet another opportunity to convince people to participate. For example, if the quiz has an educational aspect to it, you could say something like, &#8220;Test your knowledge about New Year&#8217;s traditions from around the world and then check out some fresh new traditions you can try today.&#8221; Likewise, if you plan on offering a promotion at the end, by all means, tell your audience what&#8217;s at stake. Use the description field to say something along the lines of, &#8220;Take this quiz and receive a valuable New Year&#8217;s discount.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Select eye-catching images</strong> &#8211; Your quiz will get a lot more attention if you include eye-catching images. Obviously, you&#8217;ll want to start with a main image that represents the quiz, but don&#8217;t stop there! With Qzzr, you can use images throughout the quiz. Even if you skip images for individual questions and answers, we highly recommend find excellent images for each result. After all, when people share their quiz results on social media, their friends will see them. This is your chance to capture even more attention &#8212; and what better way to do it than with great, representative images?</li>
<li><strong>Write detailed &#8220;results&#8221; that make each quiz finisher look good</strong> &#8211; People share quiz results that they feel good about. Yet, New Year&#8217;s brings with it a great deal of soul searching and resolution making. Your audience may not feel so great after making their resolutions; they&#8217;re too disorganized; their finances are a mess; or they feel out-of-shape and flabby. The beginning of the year is a great time to boost their self-esteem with quiz results that they can feel good about.</li>
<li><strong>Take full advantage of the quiz-making features available to you</strong> &#8211; Despite how easy it is to create a social media quiz with Qzzr, you have several options available to you. Make sure to put them to good use. For example, you can use social media quizzes to do even more than engage your fans on social media sites; you can also add an opt-in at the end of the quiz to collect leads or present special offers based on individual quiz results. Use these options to your advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social media quizzes are fun any time of the year, especially so around big events like the start of a new year. <a href="https://app.qzzr.com/account/signin" target="_blank">Sign into</a> your Qzzr account (or sign up for one if you don&#8217;t already have one), get creative, and create your own quiz to celebrate the New Year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you flip through your Flipboard or scroll through your newsfeed, it often seems as though everyone is posting quiz results.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Super Mario,&#8221; your cousin proclaims, and, apparently, your BFF is a &#8220;hot tamale.&#8221; The celebrity your niece is most like? Why, Taylor Swift, of course.</p>
<p>But why does someone take a quiz?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1417" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Taylor_Swift_3_2012.jpg" alt="taylor swift" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s all fun and games, but it&#8217;s also an effective form of marketing.</p>
<p>The sheer popularity of quizzes on social media coupled with the ability to gather leads, position a special offer, or drive more traffic to a website combine to make quizzes a powerful marketing tool. While it&#8217;s fairly easy to see why marketers are using quizzes, a question worth pondering is this: Why are quizzes so popular on social media platforms?</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quizzes are fun:</strong> They take about a minute to complete and another second or two to share. They&#8217;re often on topics of interest &#8212; can you say Game of Thrones? &#8212; and they give us a chance to test our knowledge.</li>
<li><strong> Quizzes are a great way to share information about yourself. </strong> Quiz results often say something about who you are and what you value, even if they are kind of goofy.</li>
<li><strong> Quizzes appeal to our sense of narcissism.</strong> We all want to look good and sharing flattering quiz results can do just that. After all, if someone, even if it is just a clever marketer, says that you&#8217;re most like Mother Teresa,  wouldn&#8217;t you want to share that?</li>
<li><strong> Quizzes are good conversation starters on social media.</strong> Your closest friends know all about your Game of Thrones fanaticism but your long lost BFF from high school may have no clue. After seeing your GOT quiz results on Facebook, now she knows. Oddly enough, she&#8217;s read all the books and has been binge-watching seasons one through four for the fourth time! Thanks to an online quiz, you find out you have something in common once again.</li>
<li><strong> Quizzes serve as a bite-sized distraction.</strong> Quizzes serve as a bite-sized distraction. All work and no play makes for a dull day, but who can afford to goof off all day long? A short quiz can be just enough of a respite from the daily grind without pulling you to far out of it. Taking a break and having a little fun is a proven way to get the creative juices flowing, too.</li>
<li><strong> Quizzes are a way to find out more about yourself.</strong> You may wonder how you compare to the so-called norm or if you&#8217;re making the best choices. Lifestyle and medical quizzes are a good way to see how you measure up or where you can improve. Best of all, they&#8217;re a non-threatening way to conduct an initial self-assessment.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are but a few of the many reasons quizzes are so appealing to users of social media. We probably missed a few. Feel free to add your own thoughts in the comments section below.</p>
