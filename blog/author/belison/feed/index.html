<p>As software engineers, our natural habitat tends to be a dimly lit nerd cave.</p>
<p>Most of us focus on the beauty of our code, the health of our servers, and fighting to keep up with the latest and greatest technologies.</p>
<p>Very rarely do we take a software engineer and put them face to face with our customers—<strong>and why not?!</strong><span id="more-1751"></span></p>
<p>It’s likely due to one of these reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s uncomfortable</li>
<li>It’s hard</li>
<li>We’re too busy</li>
</ol>
<p>It is so easy to zero in on the problems you are attempting to solve that you often forget the audience you&#8217;re attempting to solve the problem for. This needs to change.</p>
<h3>Ditch the routine</h3>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to tag along with the marketing team to the Social Media Week conference in Los Angeles. To be honest, I had some serious hesitation about subjecting myself to that level of human contact, but the experience ended up being phenomenal. Here are a few insights I took away from the experience:</p>
<h4>Marketing and Sales reps aren’t heartless, greedy monsters</h4>
<p>One of the first things that really struck me was how dedicated and amazing our marketing and sales teams are. In many organizations, sales and engineering are opposing forces, constantly struggling against one another for their own self interests. It was eye opening to see the genuine care they had for customers (existing and potential) and the desire to see them be successful on our platform. Of course sales has goals, but transactional metrics felt like secondary concerns when compared to making sure our customers were happy with the product we were providing.</p>
<h4>You can’t top facetime with customers</h4>
<p>Before the conference began, we had the opportunity to sit down with a few existing and potential customers to get feedback and brainstorm about incorporating quizzes and polls into their content strategies. These meetings were incredibly eye-opening. It was invigorating to hear success stories, as well as their challenges and struggles. In some cases, solving their pain required relatively little effort, but had it been brought back to the software engineering team, that message would likely have been lost in translation.</p>
<h4>Engineers ride in elevators, too</h4>
<p>While manning our booth, I was asked dozens of times to quickly describe what Qzzr is all about. There is something very humbling about practicing your elevator pitch. You really have to cut through the fluff and help someone understand your vision in as few words as possible. I struggled with this for a bit, and while I don&#8217;t think I ever polished my delivery as well as a standard sales team member, it did help me understand what our potential customers were most excited about.</p>
<h3>Takeaway</h3>
<p>This experience may not be for everyone, but we are adopting a rotation to allow our devs the opportunity to get out of the office for something like this. I have read posts from a variety of respectable people about getting out of the office, though I’m not sure any were directed at software engineers specifically. I can attest that it is valuable and encourage others to give it a go. <strong>Have you had any experiences with this? Share your insights in the comments below.</strong></p>
