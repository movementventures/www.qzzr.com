<p>Independence Day is this weekend and—between backyard barbecues and firework shows—many individuals will be sitting back and enjoying some free time. And what do we do when we’ve got an afternoon to waste? We get on the Internet.</p>
<p>You will see all walks of life posting to your favorite social media channel during the Fourth of July weekend. Between uploading family photos and researching the perfect fried chicken recipe, everyone is bound to skim through Facebook to peek into the lives of everyone else they know.</p>
<p>Capitalize on this social media mayhem by posting the perfect, engaging US history quiz. You will need to find a balance between holiday fun and industry relevance, but if you walk that line just right, your engagement is sure to spike.<span id="more-1766"></span></p>
<p>Need some help getting started? Here is a list of conversation-starting, thought-provoking Independence Day quiz ideas that will capture your proud customers on everyone’s favorite summer weekend!</p>
<h3>1. How Much Do You Know About US History in Pop Culture?</h3>
<p>Everyone loves a bit of pop-culture trivia. Capture audiences young and old with this engaging quiz idea where everyone can participate. Where does Independence Day appear in iconic films? Which books have used Independence Day in the plot? Get families talking about their favorite cultural stars and recommending must-see movies after a few fun questions. This taxing US history quiz is bound to dominate social media with its shareable facts and goading headline.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which Star Trek character quotes the Preamble in episode 52 of the original series, “The Omega Glory?” A: Captain Kirk</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3b56e0u0EgQ" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>2. Which Founding Father Are You?</h3>
<p>This quiz headline isn’t particularly unique, but it is catchy. In fact, as I was researching this quiz idea, I found myself taking one of the many founding father quizzes out there. In case you were wondering, I’m Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a quiz doesn’t need to be one-of-a-kind, it just needs to be memorable and timely. And what is more relevant and shareable than a personality quiz that makes people feel proud to be an American?</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>One question I thought was funny from the quiz I took was:</p>
<p>Q: How tall are you?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Fairly tall</li>
<li>Fairly short</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too old to care</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too busy fighting duels to measure</li>
</ol>
<p>(Take the quiz and share your results with us in the comments!)</p>
<h3>3. Is This Tradition From the United States or Britain?</h3>
<p>Inspire the proud American in everyone on Independence Day with a quiz that highlights the differences between the United States and our motherland. You can look at how the two countries have changed, the silly laws we kept and changed over the years, the differences in holiday traditions, and any other funny facts that will interest quiz takers. Here are some examples.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which country participates in “worm charming” to collect bait for fishing? A: <a href="http://listverse.com/2010/04/02/10-very-strange-british-traditions/" target="_blank">Britain</a>: The competition was initiated by local man Tom Shufflebotham who on July 5, 1980, charmed 511 worms from the ground in only half an hour. The game has been held every year since as a world championship. The competition has 18 rules. Music of any kind can be used to charm worms out of the ground, but no drugs can be used. Water is considered to be a drug.</p>
<p>Q: Which country uses more pumpkins to celebrate Halloween each year? A: <a href="http://www.anglotopia.net/british-identity/lost-pond-5-major-differences-english-american-halloween-traditions/" target="_blank">The United States</a>: Illinois alone uses around 500 million a year, the UK uses about 4 million a year in total.</p>
<h3>4. How Many Americans Are Actually American?</h3>
<p>Ever wondered how American you really are? The United States has long been dubbed a melting pot for different cultures, and the actual breakdown of where today’s population originated from is interesting, and sometimes shocking. Remind quiz takers of their origins and perhaps inspire people to appreciate their culture and this great country in which we live.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: True or False? Research has found that more than 6 million Americans who self-identify as European likely carry African ancestry. A: <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/21/americans-mixed-ancestry/" target="_blank">True</a>: A study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics found this to be true, and that as many as 5 million self-described European Americans might have at least 1 percent Native American ancestry as well.</p>
<h3>5. Lies US History Taught Us: Are You Smarter Than James Loewen?</h3>
<p>Want a little controversy? This time of year, we like to pull out facts from our arsenal of American history—but how much history do we really know? The bestselling book written by James Loewen in 1995, called Lies My Teacher Told Me, outlines a number of inaccuracies in our most popular history textbooks, particularly about the settling of the United States and the idealization of national heroes. Test your followers’ US history knowledge with interesting facts and ideas inspired by Loewen. You’ll give quiz takers some food for thought and establish yourself as an edgy, knowledgeable source.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: According to Lies My Teacher Told Me, how much more do American clothing workers make than their Malaysian counterparts? A: <a href="https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/loewen.html" target="_blank">1,500 times more</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Holidays are a great time to take advantage of the social engagement that quizzes offer. Take advantage of your potential customers’ free time and grab their attention with something funny, interesting or controversial, but always shareable.</p>
<p>Happy Independence Day!</p>
<p>Want some inspiration? Here&#8217;s a great US history quiz that has been taken over 140,000 times!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you too have been infected by the TV show Suits, you’ll recognize these all-too-common progressive symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch one episode of Suits</li>
<li>Obsess about Suits</li>
<li>Develop unsettling, yet secure man/woman-crush on Harvey Specter</li>
<li>Glance at your watch to realize it’s 4AM and you have a meeting in four hours</li>
<li>Watch one more episode</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve caught much of the show, you’ll know that Harvey is the kind of guy that says the exact right thing at the exact right time.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking, isn’t that exactly what I try to do as a content creator? <span id="more-1756"></span>And isn’t that commonality enough to create a lasting friendship that could include regular recreational activities together, like—I don’t know—driving cool cars, trying on <img class="  wp-image-1758 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NUP_143654_1381.jpg" alt="NUP_143654_1381.tif" width="369" height="208" />expensive suits, messing with Louis…</p>
<p>FOCUS, Coy! Sorry, back to my point. Harvey got where he is for a reason (and no, that’s not just because someone wrote that into a script). So I pulled the ten best Harvey Specter quotes and packaged them here for your content marketing enlightenment.</p>
<h3>The Top 10 Best Harvey Specter Quotes on Content Marketing</h3>
<h4>&#8220;I don&#8217;t pave the way for people&#8230; People pave the way for me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Success and innovation almost always go together, so move early and move fast. If you’re standing still, you’ll likely get passed over or lost in the fray. <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/23/attention-economy" target="_blank">There’s a finite amount of attention out there</a>, so only the most unique, best produced content even has a shot at being seen. Is Harvey the kind of guy that would throw together a sloppy blog post? Are you serious? I oughta slap you for even considering it.</p>
<h4>“I don’t play the odds, I play the man.”</h4>
<p>You didn’t know Harvey was into personalized marketing, did you? If there’s one thing you know about Harvey and Mike Ross, it’s that every situation and case is tirelessly researched. They don&#8217;t go into any scenario blindly (with a few disastrous exceptions), and eventually it’s a silver bullet of uncovered information that makes the difference.</p>
<p>Find out what makes your customer tick, then give them what they want—even if they themselves don’t know it yet.</p>
<h4>“That&#8217;s the difference between you and me—you wanna lose small, I wanna win big”</h4>
<p>Win big by finding out what works and then go in for the jugular. How do you do this? Research and testing, my friend.</p>
<p>Do those take time? Absolutely. Are they pleasant? Not always. But do they pay off? In spades. One example showed that testing even just the copy on a button <a href="http://copyhackers.com/2014/09/buttons-vs-headlines/" target="_blank">resulted in a 123% improvement</a> on clickthrough rate. I’d call that winning big, wouldn’t you?</p>
<h4>“It’s not bragging if it’s true.”</h4>
<p>Stop waiting for other people to talk about your successes—it may not happen. Potential customers need to know why they should give their time and money to you, and if they can’t find a reason, they’re gone. If you haven’t noticed, Harvey is not afraid to point out the fact that he’s the best, and I can’t remember one example of a client leaving to another firm (and staying there—if I’m wrong, let me know in the comments).</p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean you have to be insufferable about it, as Harvey occasionally is. While confidence and bravado are celebrated characteristics in high-powered NYC corporate law, you may not be able to get away with it in your space. Tout your strengths and showcase your wins, but do so tactfully.</p>
<p>And what’s even better than shouting your own praises? Having someone else tout them for you. A pleased-as-punch customer of ours recently wrote a guest post on the Uberflip blog, detailing the quiz they created, how they promoted it, and how it has <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/95454123-how-one-quiz-generated-a-million-dollars" target="_blank">generated over $1.1 million in revenue</a>.</p>
<h4>&#8220;Loyalty is a two way street. If I&#8217;m asking for it from you, then you are getting it from me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Love this one. It speaks to the symbiotic nature of companies and customers. As marketers, there is no greater goal than earning loyal customers—the kind that keep coming back time and again. However, as consumers, we value the types of businesses that listen and move to meet customer requests. It’s a complex dance in which neither party can become complacent or stationary, and every touch point is a new opportunity to strengthen or weaken that relationship.</p>
<h4>“I don’t have dreams—I have goals.”</h4>
<p>Dreams are what you spend hours thinking about, and goals are what you work tirelessly to achieve. How do you set the right kind of powerful, challenging goals? One great formula is that of <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/How-to-Set-SMART-Marketing-Goals-for-2013-TEMPLATE.aspx" target="_blank">SMART goals</a>, which says that goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Bound.</p>
<p>As an example, we set a goal in May to double the amount of <a href="http://go.qzzr.com/ebook-are-you-a-qwizard/?utm_campaign=qwizardebook&amp;utm_source=suits&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank">“Are You a Qwizard?” ebook</a> downloads, and then rolled out some new strategies to promote it. We ended up with more than a 295% increase in May, so we learned a lot about what was realistic.</p>
<h4>“I don&#8217;t get lucky. I make my own luck.&#8221;</h4>
<p>The man makes his own luck, ladies and gentlemen. Spectacular.</p>
<p>But that’s not altogether impossible. In sports, luck is thrown around a lot. “That shot was lucky” or “They got lucky” or “That was a lucky break.” Well, a lot of hard work and preparation goes into getting to the point where luck can enter into the equation.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors hadn’t done anything much more than yawn-worthy in more than 20 years. But try and tell Steph Curry that their NBA title was lucky.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="max-width: 100%;" src="//giphy.com/embed/laEnlnMj27drW" width="480" height="269" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Suits doesn’t usually do much more than allude to the hours of research and discovery that goes into their cases (if they showed it, it would be more like CSPAN, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we</span> nobody would watch it). While it’s true that you can catch a lucky break from time to time, if you’re relying on those moments to carry your marketing performance, you’re not going to last long.</p>
<h4>&#8220;The only time ‘success’ comes before ‘work’ is in the dictionary.”</h4>
<p>See above.</p>
<p>Man, Harvey can say pretty much the same thing and it still sounds so cool.</p>
<h4>“Anyone can do my job, but no one can be me.”</h4>
<p>Be irreplaceable. There are more than a million people in the US with the exact same degree, but only Harvey can be Harvey. Again, I’m aware that it’s a fictional program—but you and I both know people that have the same degree or experience that we do, but have been able to parlay that into mountainous success.</p>
<p>Look at this from a branding perspective, whether that’s from a corporate or personal standpoint. Being human is a good thing, and being yourself is even better. Brands that successfully humanize their voice enjoy more success on social media, and that translates into improved performance overall. <a href="https://moz.com/blog/4-ways-to-build-trust-and-humanize-your-brand" target="_blank">Moz has a phenomenal guide</a> to humanizing your brand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Producing quality content—whether it be on a blog or otherwise—works.</p>
<p>Study after study confirms this fact, but just for good measure, <a href="http://marketeer.kapost.com/content-strategy-2015/#axzz3bGGrNAYU">let’s hit a few up once again</a>:<span id="more-1745"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>B2B companies that blog generate 67% more leads than those that don’t.</li>
<li>72% of marketers feel that branded content is more effective than magazine advertisements.</li>
<li>Interactive content—apps, assessments, calculators, and quizzes—generates conversions moderately or very well 70% of the time, compared to 36% of the time with passive content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem arises in producing the kind of content that will resonate with an increasingly discerning public. There’s this weird phenomenon going on, where people are becoming more burned out with poorly produced “fluff” content, while searching ravenously for well-written, topical content.</p>
<p>So how do you land squarely in the latter camp—where potential customers will flock to your brand to consume, ask questions, add feedback and comments, and willingly offer up personal information in an attempt to tap into your ever-flowing nozzle of learning?</p>
<p>Recently, we had a great webinar with Skip Besthoff of InboundWriter. There was some fascinating conversation around the need for both traffic and engagement, and how to drive both.</p>
<p>We’ll embed the full video and slides at the bottom of this post, but in the meantime, here are a few tidbits of that conversation to get you pointed in the right direction:</p>
<h3>The 80/20 rule</h3>
<p>As a general rule, around 20% of your content will drive 80% of your traffic.</p>
<p>But why is this? What makes those posts so alluring? And how can you write your other posts in that vein?</p>
<p>Ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my largest source of traffic? (which specific campaign, article, etc?)</li>
<li>Which traffic converts the best?</li>
<li>Are certain types of visitors more engaged than others? Why?</li>
<li>Does engagement yield more conversions/leads?</li>
<li>What can I do to improve engagement?</li>
<li>Where should I invest resources for more traffic?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constant traffic and engagement</h3>
<p>Here’s what traffic to the average blog post will look like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.33.46-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1746" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.33.46-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-17 at 1.33.46 AM" width="1093" height="422" /></a></p>
<p>In contrast, when a post has been analytically conceived and thoughtfully written with clear engagement cues and calls to action, along with an aggressive promotion strategy, your traffic will likely begin to look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.34.07-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.34.07-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-17 at 1.34.07 AM" width="1048" height="416" /></a></p>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>As far as successful content marketing, quizzes are at the top of the world right now. Here are a few stats <a title="6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz (and How to Make It Viral) [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/">we got from our friends at Buzzsumo</a>:</p>
<p>Quizzes have a…</p>
<ul>
<li><del></del>81% completion rate</li>
<li>2:27 average completion time</li>
<li>5% lead conversion rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s pretty extraordinary, especially since those are average numbers. Competent marketers that really take their jobs seriously may exceed those figures. Seriously.</p>
<h3>Full webinar</h3>
<p>These are just a few points we pulled from the webinar. If you’d like to watch it in its entirety, the video is below. Likewise, the slides are embedded as well.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all seen them on our social feeds (and if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves, we&#8217;ve taken many of them).</p>
<p>In fact, quizzes have long been the most shared form of content on the web. In January, quizzes made up nine of the top ten most shared stories on Facebook—that&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p>But how do you tap into that power and create the type of quiz social natives flock to?</p>
<p>We met up with NUVI today to take on this challenge. You see, there&#8217;s something about quizzes that get people talking. They can&#8217;t keep from taking to Facebook and Twitter to display their scores and throw down a challenge to their friends and followers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Think you have what it takes to be an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenStack?src=hash">#OpenStack</a> Master? Take the OpenStack Challenge quiz to find out! <a href="http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2">http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2</a></p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>See? I thought <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> was an amateur Jenga tournament, and even I want to take that quiz just to prove I&#8217;m a Master (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read" target="_blank">tl;dr</a>: I&#8217;m not a Master). Even if they&#8217;re not gloating or challenging, they&#8217;re chipping in on the conversation with opinions and tidbits. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForPaul?src=hash">#ForPaul</a> MT <a href="https://twitter.com/RomanciaSays">@RomanciaSays</a>: I think I got Paul&#8217;s car. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fast7?src=hash">#Fast7</a> <a href="https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC">https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/quizzes?src=hash">#quizzes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CarListerCo">@CarListerCo</a> <a href="http://t.co/kpcRPFlhJK">pic.twitter.com/kpcRPFlhJK</a> — TV After Dark (@TVAfterDark) <a href="https://twitter.com/TVAfterDark/status/600757086239072260">May 19, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you create and promote the right quiz, social media will erupt in conversation.<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2>Check it out</h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>As you may have noticed while we were presenting, we had some technical difficulties due to a drop in internet connection. This caused some problems with the original recording. But since we wanted to make sure you got the full account, we pulled from another webinar with nearly identical content, and spliced it with the awesome insights we got from Bill and the guys at NUVI. The NUVI art starts at the 37:24 mark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media quizzes are a great way to engage with your audience in a personal and direct way, but not all quizzes are created equal. Just as any content can be created impeccably, there are a few common mistakes many quiz creators make that ruin their engagement results.</p>
<p>The secrets to reaching social media quiz sharing success are not difficult, but are often overlooked, causing numerous brands to miss out on growing their audience to new, wanting members.</p>
<h2>Don’t trip into these social media quiz pitfalls!</h2>
<h4>1. You don’t make your results shareable</h4>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to really educate your audience about your product, a quiz may not be the most in-depth solution. Quizzes are not the best format for informational posts—at least in this medium. Instead, use a social media quiz to educate users about your brand in a short, fun and conversational way.</p>
<p>Quizzes are great for brand awareness. For them to be effective, they should be easy to share. When the quiz taker gets their results, they need an immediate way to post to Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. The general consensus is that the format should show the results first and then the title of the quiz second. For example: “You’re Princess Jasmine! – Which Disney Princess Are You? Take the quiz here to find out!”</p>
<h4>2. Your quiz is too long</h4>
<p>With the average attention span at an alltime low, you have just a few short seconds to engage your audience with useful, entertaining content before they move on to the next shiny thing.</p>
<p>The most successful quizzes average between seven and ten questions. Keep your questions succinct and to the point; big blocks of text are sure to yield fewer results than pithy inquiries. And keep your results short as well. It is a delicate balance, however. You definitely want people taking social media quizzes to feel like they’re receiving quality feedback at the end of the quiz, so dip much less than seven and your credibility will suffer. But, as a general rule, wordy explanations that take longer to read result in fewer shares.</p>
<h4>3. You don’t use enough (good) images</h4>
<p>Make up for less text by using quality images. The old saying, “a picture is worth a thousand words,” holds true in quizzes as much as anything else.</p>
<div class="mv-widget" data-widget="poll" data-id="UuUdehUt7qnKXxzDpLIKwH7ymH2" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></div>
<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>If you’re going to spend a lot of time on any aspect of the quiz you’re creating, spend it on the most focal image. The main image seen is what draws users to your quiz in the first place.</p>
<p>Images historically receive more shares on social media than text, and a quiz post is made up of 80% image. Ultimately, the photo replaces the “lede sentence” that hooks the audience in a typical text post.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank"><img class="  wp-image-1700 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Images-CTA.png" alt="Images CTA" width="305" height="159" /></a>Not just any cool image will do here. Your lede photo should be relevant to your content, as well as high quality. A low resolution, pixelated image will be scrolled over by most viewers. Studies also show that <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/01/brain-face-recognition/" target="_blank">images with faces tend to do better than photos without</a>. The human brain is programed to look for other humans. These images are familiar and relatable, which makes them more clickable and shareable.</p>
<p>Images don’t just apply to the introduction to your quiz, either. High quality photos should be sprinkled throughout. Use images as questions or answers in your quiz, and especially to demonstrate the results.</p>
<h4>4. Your title sucks</h4>
<p>A close second to finding a great lede image is creating a catchy title. Think of it as the image drawing their attention, but the title giving the audience a reason to click. In fact, research shows that <a href="https://moz.com/blog/are-your-titles-irresistibly-click-worthy-viral" target="_blank">80% of post clicks</a> are motivated by a headline alone.</p>
<p>Your title should stick out in the massive content mill of social media, so here are a few tried and true tricks to make your social media quiz stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favorite the Famous</strong> &#8211; Studies show that people are more likely to click on a title with a celebrity’s name in it than one without. Why? We like to see ourselves as celebrities and we relate to famous things. Who wouldn’t want to be like Beyonce or doesn’t see a bit of their own friend group in the “Friends” cast?</li>
<li><strong>Rate Users</strong> &#8211; These headings are best used for personality quizzes. Titles like, “Which Television Anti-hero Are You?” give you a creative way to rate and analyze people, which users then want to share with their friends.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of “Actually”</strong> &#8211; You can easily turn a boring title into something provocative by throwing in the word “actually.” Instead of asking, “What’s Your Sense of Humor?” entice users by saying, “Do You Actually Have a Sense of Humor?”</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Your quiz is depressing</h4>
<p>Users don’t take a social media quiz to feel badly about themselves. <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/make-quiz-like-buzzfeed/" target="_blank">Boost your quiz shareability with positive results</a> that make people excited to brag about it on social media.</p>
<p>It might seem like a controversial result technique will be provocative enough to get shares, but the research shows otherwise.</p>
<p>Don’t bum users out with negative feedback, but don’t lie either. Results that are too broad or overly positive feel like they’re pandering, and people are less likely to share those with friends. Instead, focus your questions and results around uplifting verbiage and honest answers.</p>
<h4>6. Your quiz is a trap</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trap.png"><img class="  alignright wp-image-1702" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trap.png" alt="social media quiz trap" width="332" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>And not in a good way.</p>
<p>This goes back to the purpose of using quizzes in your marketing strategy. The goal of quizzes isn’t always to get leads, but also to create educational and entertaining ways to spread brand awareness. You don’t necessarily need to use quizzes to create an email newsletter mailing list, but instead could use them as a fun format designed for shareability about your brand. Pair the message with the intended result, and compare that to where the audience is in respect to your funnel.</p>
<p>You can generate leads from a social media quiz, but this is done through providing personalized recommendations, not blackmailing quiz users into giving you their information. If your quiz can help users determine the type of product you offer that most suits their needs, they may be motivated to subscribe to your newsletters or purchase a product. But that decision should be the user’s initiative, not yours.</p>
<p>Trapping people into giving you personal information before showing results will lead most users to opt-out of your quiz all together, which means you don’t get to show them more information about your brand, lift their spirits, or get social media shares that drive more traffic. When people feel like they’re given something that was tailored for them, they’re much more likely to opt-in, as opposed to just being blindly marketed at.</p>
<h4>7. Your quiz is boring</h4>
<p>Buzzfeed, one of the most successful websites using quiz-based traffic generation, keeps their audience clicking with engaging content, both visually and integrally. Big, colorful fonts and lots of images keep the user entertained aesthetically while the conversational, witty content engages their mind.</p>
<p>Avoid using quizzes as methods for hardcore learning, and instead don’t be afraid to be funny, and even snarky in your quiz content. Studies show that using personal pronouns, like “I,” “we” and “you,” create a more conversational, personalized tone that prompts readers to view and share your quiz.</p>
<p>This especially applies to the results of your quiz. <a title="Why People Share Awesome Content" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/people-share/" target="_blank">Users want to feel like their results are unique and specially tailored just for them</a>, so write your results as if you’re writing to a single person, not a large audience. Try picturing a friend that matches the answers you’re writing and create content directly to them. It will come out more casual and connected than writing to an imaginary audience, which can seem formulaic.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Become a quiz-creating guru by inserting these simple steps into your everyday process. Orchestrating outstanding quizzes that engage your audience and build your brand is an attainable skill if you avoid these common quiz mistakes.</p>

<p>A 5% lead conversion rate is a lot like asking your cousin to prom. Sure—it&#8217;s better than nothing, but you and I both know it could be a whole lot better.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s webinar, we sat down with Sushant Sharma of <a href="https://vwo.com/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a> to discuss how quizzes are driving killer conversion rates. To say it was a helpful conversation would be grossly inadequate. Read on to get a few insights into the process behind 20-30% conversion rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/marketing-quiz" target="_blank">As I recently discussed on the Wordstream blog</a>, we recently discovered that Qzzr quizzes ending with lead capture forms were successful at acquiring a lead 10% of the time. Yeah, that&#8217;s the average! It only took basic marketing prowess to get above average conversion rates.</p>
<p>What would you do if your conversion rates were that high?</p>
<p>Owen and Sushant shared countless quiz tips (and you really should watch the webinar below to get all of them), but we&#8217;ll highlight just three that will get you started:</p>
<h4>Know your audience</h4>
<p>Quizzes and polls are examples of interactive content, but without knowing who you&#8217;re designing the quiz for, there&#8217;s not going to be much interaction. Here&#8217;s a quick diagram that illustrates precisely the mindset you should be in when designing your quiz.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1669" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-29-at-12.03.14-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-29 at 12.03.14 AM" width="1074" height="603" /></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t do you a bit of good to create a quiz that only you would want to take. This seems obvious, but it&#8217;s remarkably common. Learn as much as you can about your target personas.</p>
<p>What challenges do they face? What entertains them? What do they want to learn more about? Maybe draw inspiration from the news or pop culture, depending on your audience. Find that happy middle where interaction flows naturally. Turn that prom date from awkward cousin conversation into riveting, engaging dialogue. That&#8217;s what spurs an above average conversion rate.</p>
<h4>Show me something cool</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png"><img class="  wp-image-1671 alignright" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png" alt="dogbounty" width="378" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Quizzes are by nature much more social than other forms of content. They&#8217;re personal. So ditch the office-speak and loosen the tie and have a little fun with it.</p>
<p>Remember this quiz from the webinar? Again, pardon the crass title, but it&#8217;s not what you think. This is from the College Humor quiz <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6971979/quiz-whose-boobs-are-these">&#8220;Whose cleavage is this?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t recognize him, this is Dog the Bounty Hunter. While I&#8217;m not sure if I would classify his cleavage as &#8220;cool,&#8221; you get the point. This quiz is engaging because it&#8217;s out of the ordinary and combats the overarching assumption.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another one, since we&#8217;re on the bounty hunter theme (no, I&#8217;m not going to make any references to the <del>hit</del> <a href="https://youtu.be/e4N220XLowE" target="_blank">90s bounty hunter-themed TV show Renegade</a>). When Sideshow Collectibles made this quiz: <a href="https://www.sideshowtoy.com/blog/quiz-which-star-wars-bounty-hunter-are-you" target="_blank">&#8220;Which Star Wars bounty hunter are you?&#8221;</a>, they could&#8217;ve asked simple, straightforward questions. But they saw the magic of a quiz, and created questions like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png"><img class="  wp-image-1672 alignleft" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png" alt="scum" width="459" height="275" /></a></p>
<p>A quiz is not a real assessment. You aren&#8217;t confined by the bounds of scientific thought and limits, so again—have some fun with it.</p>
<h4>Help me feel sufficiently assessed</h4>
<p>I know I just said quizzes aren&#8217;t real assessments, but I wasn&#8217;t completely serious. They need to retain some degree of legitimacy for people to invest in the result. If your quiz is three questions long, but then you try and offer me insights about who I am, it&#8217;s not going to seem legitimate to me and I&#8217;ll be significantly less likely to share my results.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1673" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png" alt="how many questions" width="1024" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>The quiz on the left isn&#8217;t likely to make me feel confident in the result I get. &#8220;Oh, I should buy a Lexus? You asked me three questions, I don&#8217;t think you know me well enough to make that kind of call.&#8221; However, in the quiz on the right, there are 10 questions to ascertain my personality, preferences, and character. So the fact that I get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_302_Mustang" target="_blank">Boss 302</a> makes me want to brag about it to my friends.</p>

<h5>Tips for creating international quizzes</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>With Qzzr, global quiz creation is now available in 14 languages</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will help you create interactive content in an international world, but many of these global quiz techniques apply directly to overall marketing and content creation as well.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Use the advice inasmuch as it makes sense to do so, but never take anything as a hard and fast rule. Every country and culture (and the many subsets within) is different, and the moment you assume anything, you lose the indispensable ability to adapt.<br />
</em><br />
In the old days (pre-Kardashian), when a tech company decided to expand globally, it usually meant one of two things: (1) domestic business had stabilized to the point that taking on the risks of moving into new markets seemed justified, or (2) they were bat-sh** crazy.</p>
<p>Today, our environment couldn’t be more different. The expansion of the internet and web-based SaaS tools has all but eliminated most of the barriers preventing expansion into international spaces. Potential foreign customers are looking for you before you can look for them. There’s one rapidly-growing market, and everyone is playing in it.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it’s easy, however—especially in the marketing world. The mere ability to reach out and tap people on the other side of the world in seconds doesn’t mean that they’ll want to listen to—or be able to understand—what you have to say.</p>
<h2>Consider these tips when building a global quiz strategy:</h2>
<h3>1. Find boots on the ground</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1588" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boots.png" alt="When creating a global quiz strategy, make sure you have boots on the ground." width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>Don’t try and do this alone, and from a different country. Find someone local that loves your brand as much as you do, and who brings the right blend of creativity and technical skills to the table. Don’t skimp on payment, as this person or team of people will be the backbone of your operation.</p>
<h3>2. Do your research</h3>
<p>With any marketing campaign, research is important. When trying to get a marketing effort off the ground in a new country, research is essential. Quiz creation is no different. While there are certain techniques that will translate to any campaign, you’ll find that many (if not most) of the normal methods will need at least some adjustment.</p>
<p>There are an innumerable amount of factors to consider, but begin your effort here:</p>
<h4>Personas</h4>
<p>Who is your ideal customer and how will they interact with your brand? Address differences in organizational structure, decision making, and budgetary management. It’s possible that the job titles and roles that you targeted domestically don’t exist in a new culture, or that they handle different responsibilities.</p>
<p>Your ideal customer may also have very different challenges than what you’re used to. You need to identify the individual pain points and evaluate how your product or service can resolve them. This will determine how you structure your content, and how they’ll perceive it.</p>
<p>It’s also very possible that they find information in a very different way than you’re used to. Whereas before you had a lot of success promoting quizzes on social media, you may find that these channels are dry in a new environment.</p>
<p>There has been much written on the practice of defining buyer personas, so I won’t go into more detail. <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide" target="_blank">Buffer</a> has a great guide, as does <a href="http://offers.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>—and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2014/10/28/how-to-develop-your-buyer-persona-and-reel-in-better-customers/" target="_blank">a great article from Forbes</a>. What’s important is that you use them. Don’t try and get by on your existing personas, or worse—on winging it. Take the time to understand your new audience, and your quizzes will be much more successful.</p>
<h4>Competition</h4>
<p>Who else is present in your market, and how will their offerings affect yours? Find gaps and use these in your quizzes and other content. If you provide a necessary service, make sure you use that fact in your messaging.</p>
<h4>Cultural considerations</h4>
<p>Everyone has heard a story or two about an over-eager salesman blowing a major deal by inadvertently insulting his foreign hosts. Don’t let that be you.</p>
<p>Quizzes are by nature interactive—they require customer involvement. While there is incredible opportunity for engagement and conversion there—and we’ve obviously built our business around that—their involvement means you have to consider what is going to attract and repel potential customers in your new area.</p>
<h4>Social networks</h4>
<p>While Facebook is the definite worldwide leader in social media, it’s not the top dog everywhere—Japanese Twitter users outnumber Facebook accounts by nearly 4 million, and that divide is likely to widen. And did you know that Twitter is only the fifth most popular social media network in the world?</p>
<p>Find out where the important conversations are taking place and position yourself there. Test to find out where people are most likely to share, then center your quiz promotion there to drive social traffic and generate leads.</p>
<h4>Techniques</h4>
<p>You’re entering a new space, where new temperatures, attitudes, and preferences prevail. Your old bag of tricks may not cut it—whether you’ll need to adjust tactics isn’t the question, it’s how much and in what ways.</p>
<p>You may have to find out whether quizzes resonate better within your content marketing or social media strategies. And an accurate understanding of email usage will go a long way towards determining how much time and resources you need to spend on email marketing.</p>
<p>Also consider the cultural perception of things like jokes—while your sense of humor may be your greatest asset in building relationships and communities for your brand, it’s going to be a lot harder to convey that through a translator. Even in your native tongue, humor can differ from region to region (see “Bean, Mr.”).</p>
<h4>Web consumption habits</h4>
<p>You’ll want to identify how people use the internet. Find out a breakdown of mobile/desktop usage, and this will help you construct your content. If you’re using a quiz platform like Qzzr, no need to worry! Quizzes are all responsive, all the time, meaning they’ll look great however people consume them.</p>
<p>While this is becoming less of an issue worldwide, consider your audience’s access to internet. In many places, the majority of people use the internet in cafes or have limited bandwidth. If either of these is the case, consider limiting the length of the quiz or keeping hi-res or animated images to a minimum.</p>
<h3>3. Be human</h3>
<p>Cultural differences aside, we are all still human, which means we need to engage with our customers as such. If done right, quizzes engage people in a peer-to-peer manner, because they’re playing against themselves—or their own perception of themselves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1578" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stop-telling-me-quote.jpg" alt="Stop telling me quote" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>This will greatly affect how your brand transitions to a new culture, and testifies to the need for great people on the ground. Don’t waste an engagement opportunity by sounding like an inanimate (foreign) entity.</p>
<h3>4. Have the right tools</h3>
<p>If you have the right tools, international expansion will be much easier. In another recent Forbes post, online entrepreneur John Rampton <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/05/15/how-to-grow-and-manage-international-teams/" target="_blank">shared a list of tools to use when managing an international team</a>.</p>
<p>While communicating with a team of people whose first language is not that of your business, you’ll obviously face challenges. But above and beyond that, you need to make sure they’re able to understand and use the tools involved in their day-to-day operations. Make sure their tools speak to them in their own way—you can’t afford not to. They won’t use what they don’t understand, and at this point, your endeavor is substantially dependent on data.</p>
<p>The list will be very industry-specific, but start with your CRM, marketing automation platform, email marketing and—obviously—quiz creation tool. All of these will play into how successful your campaign will be. Your quiz will be affected by how well preparation, execution, and follow up are tracked, so make sure your data integrity is on point.</p>
<p>Cool note: Did you know that Qzzr is multilingual? You can currently build quizzes in several different languages—14 to be exact:</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>Chinese Simplified</li>
<li>Dutch</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<ul>
<li>Norwegian</li>
<li>Portuguese</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Swedish</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Polish</li>
<li>Serbian</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>5. Images</h3>
<p>Just two quick notes on images. First—use them. Second—make sure they reflect your new environment. A quiz is not going to be nearly as engaging if it’s filled with imagery that looks foreign or impersonal.</p>
<p>Don’t let this happen:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1590" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Cultural-imagery-1.png" alt="Cultural imagery (1)" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>This is not just about race—though you should consider that. There are landscape/environmental variances, demographic factors, and overall cultural themes that will either make your campaign stick out like a sore thumb, or seamlessly integrate with the consumer’s life. Don’t blow the powerful engaging feeling of a quiz by using images that alienate or confuse.</p>
<h3>6. Test and improve</h3>
<p>What you need most is the ability to adapt to new circumstances, like some sort of highly intelligent mutant quizzing chameleon—yeah, like that. Test mercilessly and endlessly to determine your best course of action. Play with brand voice, images, quiz types and topics, and time of launch to determine your best playbook. You’ll know when you get it right—your share rate will reflect it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Expanding into new markets is not easy—but don’t let it discourage you. It can be done, and the rewards are many. Put in the hard work, and you’ll start to reap the benefits of global quiz domination. But please, use your powers for good.</p>

<p>We had an awesome webinar last week with Nicole Kroese from Likeable Local. Jokes were made, fun times were had, and a whole heap of helpful information was imparted. We learned that Owen would look great in a double-strap tankini and that Nicole is a dancer – but most of all, <strong>we learned how to make a quiz and intelligently promote it to double your social engagement and conversion</strong>. Yeah, heavy stuff.</p>
<h5>&gt;&gt;Want to make a quiz? <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/pricing/">Sign up for a free account</a> and work along with us!</h5>
<p>Feel free to watch the webinar, or check out the slides – <a title="[Webinar] Likeable Local + Qzzr: How to Create World Class Quizzes" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/webinar-world-class-quizzes/" target="_blank">both were posted immediately</a> after the webinar.</p>
<h3>Why make a quiz to promote your brand?</h3>
<p>Quizzes are at the forefront of a content renaissance. The internet is flooded with content, and most of it not very good. Your goal as a top shot marketer is to help yours cut through the fog and stand out.</p>
<p>Surveys, infographics, and lists are great and all, but quizzes hold more potential than many of today’s other popular content types. Luckily for you, we’re going to show you precisely why.</p>
<p>Aren’t quizzes just the same as surveys?</p>
<p>No – here’s why:</p>
<h4>Surveys come wrapped in desperation</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Please-Sir-Survey-small.jpeg" alt="survey vs quiz" width="550" height="733" /></p>
<p>While very similar in nature, quizzes capture people’s attention and draw them in – they can’t get enough! The proof is in the pudding: the New York Times’ most shared article in 2013 was a quiz, and nine of the ten most shared posts on Facebook in January 2015 were as well.</p>
<h4>So why are quizzes so irresistible?</h4>
<p>We think it’s because they’re so engaging and nourishing. We can’t wait to get a result and find out something interesting about ourselves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1578" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stop-telling-me-quote.jpg" alt="Stop telling me quote" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>Quizzes have an 81% completion rate – people stick with them. <strong>The questions <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/79684693-is-your-content-an-enthralling-conversation-or-an-awkward-goodbye" target="_blank">act like an interesting conversation</a>, which drives them to share little bits of themselves in order to learn more</strong>. What’s more is that 82% of people will take a quiz if they see it in their social feed. So you post a quiz – on average, 82% of the people that see it will start it, and 81% of those people will finish it.</p>
<p>Is that not impressive enough for you? The average quiz takes roughly two and a half minutes to complete (which does wonders for your SEO), and is shared over 1,900 times (which is pretty good, if we say so ourselves).</p>
<p><strong>All of this combines to make quizzes faster, cheaper, and more effective than almost any other type of content.</strong></p>
<p>Social media and content mavens have two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive traffic</li>
<li>Drive conversions</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of quizzes that have done that:</p>
<p>News site <a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=29674897" target="_blank">KSL.com created a quiz</a> to test people’s knowledge of the US Citizenship Test. It’s been been taken over 137,000 times (!) and the comment board got lit up.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="5235"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script>CarThrottle is an online automotive enthusiasts’ community. They posted a quiz, <a href="http://www.carthrottle.com/post/how-much-of-a-petrolhead-are-you-really-70-per-cent-means-youre-doing-well/" target="_blank">Are You a True Gearhead?</a>, and it’s been taken over 300,000 times – at the time of this writing, it had 473 comments. If that’s not traffic, I don’t know what is.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="676"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>Online optics company Zenni Optical <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/glasses-quiz" target="_blank">launched a quiz to help people find the eyeglass style</a> that best represented them. Questions drew out information on color, lifestyle, and face shape to provide an accurate recommendation. It has worked – <strong>to the tune of <a title="The Anatomy of the Million Dollar Quiz [Webinar]" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/million-dollar-quiz-revenue/" target="_blank">nearly $1 million in revenue</a>, and climbing</strong>.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="7951"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script>So, how do I make a quiz?</p>
<h3>Research topics</h3>
<p>You can make a quiz, or you can make a great quiz. Studying great content can give you insights into what will perform well for you. Ask these questions to set yourself up for success from the get-go: What’s trending right now? What topics have been successful for you in the past? Have any of your competitors made quizzes before? Which topics have been most successful? Are there decisions that people struggle to make? We don’t get any kickbacks from <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com" target="_blank">Buzzsumo</a> for saying this, but we’ve found their tool extremely helpful for research on buzzworthy topics. Try it out and see if it’s any good for you.</p>
<h3>Choose quiz title and type</h3>
<p>Your title is your quiz’s headline, so the same thought should go into it. You want to engage people – make them want to drill in and get a result. There are two quiz types: graded and outcome. Graded quizzes follow the traditional quiz archetype – they have right or wrong answers. The end result of a graded quiz is a percentage (You got ___% of the questions correct). An outcome quiz does not have right or wrong answers; it’s questions gather information to lead to – you guessed it – an outcome (You got “AC Slater” in the “Which Saved By The Bell character are you?” quiz). Here are a few quiz title examples given for each quiz type: <a href="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Quiz-types.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Quiz-types.png" alt="Quiz types" width="560" height="315" /></a> If you’d like more information on what each quiz type offers, <a title="Graded or Outcome? Tap Into the Psychology of Quiz Types" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/graded-or-outcome-psychology-of-quiz-types/" target="_blank">we’ve written before with a bit more detail</a>.</p>
<h3>Do your research and gather media</h3>
<p>This is where you’ll strategize your quiz content. If you’re creating a graded quiz, you’ll need a lot of facts. If it’s an outcome quiz, be strategic and fun about how you ask for information. Example: In your “Which farm animal are you?” quiz, don’t ask “Which food sounds good?” and then show pictures of hay, corn, oats, etc. Come up with another way of getting responses that aren’t so obvious and boring. Images must be used in accordance with all copyrights and restrictions. Here’s a resource on <a title="Qzzr Answers: Images and Qzzr" href="http://www.qzzr.com/blog/images-qzzr/" target="_blank">finding images for quizzes</a>, and DesignRope has a great blog post with <a href="http://designrope.com/design/find-stock-photos-dont-suck/" target="_blank">14 places to find stock photos that don’t suck</a>.</p>
<h3>Create and embed</h3>
<p>If you have all of your stuff together, this is the easy part. <a href="http://www.qzzr.com" target="_blank">Use a platform like Qzzr</a> to make life easy on yourself, and you’ll be impressed with the imagery as well.</p>
<h3>Share and promote</h3>
<p>This was where Nicole and Likeable Local’s expertise really shines. Content used to promote itself – you could create a website and throw some words and pictures on it, and people would come to it. Not anymore. For one thing, the internet is now inundated with clutter. “Content” is everywhere, and it can be hard to cut through the fog to be seen by your prospects. In addition, things like “<a href="http://www.inc.com/dave-kerpen/facebook-reachageddon-is-coming-3-key-solutions-for-your-business.html" target="_blank">Facebook Reachageddon</a>” made us pay to play. It’s now necessary to open up the wallet to make sure your posts get seen. It’s not all doom n’ gloom, though. If you create high quality and relevant quizzes, and promote them well, they WILL pay off. Here’s where more research pays off: (Are you detecting a theme?) <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1585" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Where-are-prospects-hanging-out.png" alt="Where are prospects hanging out?" width="1277" height="426" /> Social media has a 100% higher lead-to-close rate than outbound marketing, so spend the bulk of your time there. Use these two ways to get your content in front of the right prospects:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Run awesome paid social ads</li>
<li>Create and expand your fan club</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h4> Run awesome paid ads</h4>
<p>Unless you want to waste your money, follow these bits of advice when creating ads:</p>
<p><strong>Set goals</strong> – But not the generic ones like “I’d like to be successful with this campaign.” Nah, you gotta set SMART goals. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SET-SMART-GOALS.png" alt="set smart goals" width="1024" height="512" /> Some of this is already built into the social ads platform. Do you want your ad to:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>send people to your website?</li>
<li>increase conversions on your website?</li>
<li>boost your posts?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1582" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ad-campaign-goals.png" alt="social media ad campaign goals" width="1330" height="675" /> <strong>Reach the right people</strong> – Here’s Likeable Local’s founder, Dave Kerpen, on reaching the right people:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
You know what&#8217;s cooler than reaching 1 billion people on Facebook? Reaching the perfect 1000. Or 100. or 10. — Dave Kerpen (@DaveKerpen) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveKerpen/status/313643603748614144">March 18, 2013</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>One way to do this is by creating smart audiences. Facebook allows you to build wide profiles of potential customers by adding particular demographic, interest, job title, or location filters. The robustness by which you can find the right people is really cool, actually.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583" src="http://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/audiences.png" alt="audiences" width="643" height="466" /></p>
<p><strong>Scale smarter</strong> – Don’t run before you can walk. There’s no need to. Follow these three pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double down on what’s working</li>
<li>You may be sick of your ad, but your prospects aren’t</li>
<li>Adapt to current trends</li>
</ul>
<h4>Create and expand your fan club</h4>
<p>If what you’re bringing to the table is truly meaningful and you can get it in front of people effectively, you WILL attract potential customers. Make sure that when they come to you, you’re prepared to turn them into raving fans. Here’s how you can do that:</p>
<p><strong>Choose a strategic partner</strong> – A good partner means doubled promotion and visibility. Even more so if you find someone with a larger reach than you. Look for thought leaders in your industry, and complementary companies (those that don’t directly compete with you for customers, but that contribute different value).</p>
<p><strong>Make sharing easy and fun</strong> – All content should have a call to action, preferably to share. Cool new tools like Click to Tweets make it easy for readers to share a pre-designed tweet.</p>
<p><strong>Listen and respond</strong> – Track keywords, hashtags and mentions that affect your industry or brand, and respond to everyone, because…</p>
<p><strong>Social media is the new word of mouth</strong> – 90% of people trust business recommendations from someone they know, and people are 4X more likely to buy when referred by a friend. If this is true, then you know the inverse is true as well – so make sure you promptly address negative comments as well.</p>
<p>Social ads, shared posts, and popular content have built in endorsements from friends – potential customers will see reference to friends who have liked your page or content you’ve shared.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Quizzes hold immense power to engage and convert your potential customers, but like any other content, they’re only effective if people see them. Luckily, there are experts like Owen and Nicole, who love sharing the tips and tricks that have made them and their companies successful.</p>
