				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Quizzes are the new list articles, according to Harvard University’s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/02/are-quizzes-the-new-lists-what-buzzfeeds-latest-viral-success-means-for-publishing/">Neiman Journalism Lab</a>.</p>
<p>While list articles have enjoyed popularity for sometime on big websites like Buzzfeed and The Daily Mail, their reign may be coming to an end with the dawn of the online quiz. From serious topics like “Which college should I attend?” to more lighthearted themes like “What breakfast cereal am I?”, people are flocking to online quizzes in droves every day across just about every social media platform.</p>
<p>A new tool is now available to help publishers and websites build unlimited quizzes for users to take and share across the Internet. It’s called Qzzr, a free quiz creation tool that can be used in pretty much any context.<span id="more-88"></span></p>
<p>“This tool can be used for teachers to create quick assignments for their classes,” Qzzr co-founder Josh Little said. “It can be used in training for new employees. It can be used by teens who want to find out what their friends know about them. There are virtually endless ways this tool can be used.”</p>
<p>“We’re seeing publishers use quizzes to get their content out there with more shares and user engagement,” Qzzr co-founder Josh Little said. “Marketers are using quizzes to segment users, drive them to offers based on responses, capture leads, and spread brand awareness. Of course, teachers can user Qzzr to quiz their students too. The possibilities are endless.”</p>
<p>“The best aspect of Qzzr is it’s free,” Little said</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1183 size-full" src="http://new.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Score-results-screenshot.png" alt="Score-results-screenshot" width="746" height="583" /></p>
<p>Qzzr allows users to build, embed and share their own quizzes online. Quizzes can be peppered with images, animated GIFs and other features to draw more eyes.</p>
<p>“Quizzes let people take some of the ‘me drug’.” Josh Little, Qzzr co-founder, said. “Buzzfeed and the NYTimes kicked off the quiz craze with two incredibly viral quizzes ‘What State Do You Actually Belong In?’ and ‘How Y’all, Youse and You Guys Talk’.”</p>
<p>While these quizzes were successful, Little said, the publishers had to put their own resources into building theses quizzes.</p>
<p>“The problem is those publishers have spent a ton of cash building their own tools,” He said. “Most people just can&#8217;t do that. With Qzzr, anyone can get the same amazing results for their own site, brand, or blog.”</p>
<p>Recently, Qzzr launched the capability to create outcome-based quizzes. This allow takers to plug in preferential information and determine which “whatever” they would be.</p>
<p>“We’ve joked that Qzzr is ‘the identity crisis generator’,” Dan Garfield, Qzzr’s lead marketer. “Users make quizzes that let their fans find out what 1980s cartoon character they are, what famous Civil War general they would have been, or what type of tree they might be.”</p>
<p>Qzzr allows users to create quizzes in an interactive format, Garfield said. Each question appears by itself and gives feedback after a response is made. This helps users remember, learn, and engage with the content.</p>
<p>While Qzzr is free to use, some features are reserved for pro publishers or marketers. For instance, free quizzes, embedded or not, drive shares back to Qzzr’s website but with Pro, quizzes can drive shares to the publisher’s embedded version of the quiz.</p>
<p>Unlike most embeddable quizzes out there, Garfield said, this makes it possible for the publisher to get full credit for the content they created.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The team has been hard at work to bring new features to Qzzr. All of these features are available, starting today, for all users. Tell us what you think below.<span id="more-61"></span></p>
<h2>Images and animated GIFs</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-06-at-4.47.57-PM-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-06-at-4.47.57-PM-1.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-06 at 4.47.57 PM-1" width="750" height="605" /></a><br />
Animated gifs are one of our favorite modes of communication in the office. Who doesn’t love a good gif? Beyond gifs you can now ask and answer questions using images. This opens up all kinds of great questions: “who/where/what is this?”, “pick your favorite…”, or ”which one of these babies is the cutest?”</p>
<p>(This guy for sure)</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/baby-amazed-scared-laughing-1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-66 alignnone" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/baby-amazed-scared-laughing-1.gif" alt="baby-amazed-scared-laughing-1" width="295" height="222" /></a></p>
<h2>Outcome based quizzes</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/png.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-65 alignnone" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/png.png" alt="png" width="414" height="347" /></a></p>
<p>We’ve all seen the “What kind of X am I?&#8221; quizzes blowing up and taking over our feeds. Now you can build your own on Qzzr. You can even map multiple results to each answer. For instance, if you were trying to identify a favorite ninja turtle you could ask if the weapon is made of metal or wood. Donatello would be on wood and the rest would be mapped to metal. Easy!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.co/make/new">Try making a quiz</a></p>
<h2>Pro is on its way</h2>
<p>We have some features on the way that will help publishers and content marketers take their quizzes to the next level.</p>
<h3>Better embeds that drive shares</h3>
<p>Make a quiz, embed it, and have it drive shares back to your own site. As much as we love the thousands of shares coming to our site we know that pros want the shares to drive more traffic to their site.</p>
<h3>Offer matching</h3>
<p>We can help you find the patterns in the way people take quizzes signal that they’re ready for an offer. Quizzes are the ultimate lead qualification tool. If someone answered this way give them an offer, otherwise encourage them to share. You get the best of virality and offers.</p>

<p><strong>More than a third</strong> of our quizzers were eschewing the formal computer for the more informal mobile device. The OS split was about what you&#8217;d expect. With Windows and Macintosh split evenly and iOS taking a slight lead over Android.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44" src="http://blog.qzzr.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/OS-Distribution-of-Quizzers.png" alt="OS Distribution of Quizzers" width="548" height="402" /></p>
<p>Astonishingly our mobile segment was split across 34 devices.</p>
<p>What does all this tell us?</p>
<p><strong>People want to quiz on mobile!</strong> They want to quiz from the couch, from the bus (hopefully not while driving), they want to quiz while waiting in line. They want to learn and test their knowledge everywhere. Remember when your job made you take a test last year and it was only compatible with Internet Explorer 8? That&#8217;s dead. It became a totally unacceptable state of affairs years ago but assessment hasn&#8217;t caught up until Qzzr.</p>
<p>Break out your favorite mobile device and go try out a Quiz, how&#8217;s it working for you? We&#8217;d love to have your feedback.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Test.  Exam.  Quiz.  Educational assessment.  How do those words make you feel?</h2>
<div>
<p>A number is a powerful thing.  It can be used to give exact measurement.  It can say what 1000 words can’t.  It can easily be compared to other numbers.  It can also be used to beat people over the head.  Somewhere along the way, the idea of feedback in the learning process became punitive.</p>
<h2>A relevant human experience</h2>
<p>Seeking feedback is a profoundly relevant human experience.  If our mere existence as humans is to progress, then feedback is what makes that existence relevant.   We are constantly seeking feedback to understand our surroundings.</p>
<p>Is this safe? What time do I need to wake up?  How long will it take me to brush my teeth?  Does he like me?  Why are they looking at me like that?  Can I play this song again without a making a mistake?  Have I done my good deed for the day?</p>
<p>Feedback is a necessary and natural part of growth.  Therefore, feedback is a necessary part of learning.</p>
<h2>Growth doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</h2>
<p>Everything happens in relation to its context.  You can’t understand growth unless you can relate it to or measure it against something.</p>
<p>How do you know if you’ve grown taller?  You can’t feel it.  You can see it in a mirror or picture, but can’t tell unless you relate it to something.  These pants look too short.  I’m taller than my sister now.  I can now see on top of the refrigerator….yuck…let’s clean it.</p>
<p>To understand growth in learning we must have feedback just like to understand the growth of our body we must have a mark on the wall.  It’s all feedback.  It’s all necessary.</p>
<h2>Feedback is not evil, evil is.</h2>
<p>The question is….how do we feel about it?  Do we get nervous when we step up to the wall to measure ourselves?  Do we agonize for days in advance?  Do we resent the lower marks on the wall?  Of course not.  In fact, it’s just the opposite.  We’re eager to see how we’ve grown.  We’re proud of progress.  We’re completely satisfied by looking at those lower marks because they tell us how far we’ve come.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t assessment in the learning process feel as rewarding as measuring our height on the wall?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>“Wait…no it doesn’t.  I get physically sick with sweaty palms when I have to take a test.”</p>
<p>Aha!  Why?  Let’s explore this.  This is getting good.  Think for a moment.  What are you good at?  What do you like learning about?  What do you spend your time doing?</p>
<p>Do you have a few topics?</p>
<p>Now….what if someone started asking you questions about those things?  How would that feel?  Would you enjoy that conversation?  Absolutely.  It would be invigorating talking about things you love or are passionate about.  In fact, you would probably know all of the answers to just about any question on the topic.</p>
<p>What if that person asking the questions was keeping track of how many questions you could answer correctly and telling you how impressed they were along the way?  Would that bother you?  Not at all.  It would feel good.</p>
<p>What if sent a link to a quiz on one of your favorite topics?  Would you be nervous to take it?  Not at all.  You would probably stop what you were doing immediately and take it.  It would be fun.</p>
<p>Aren’t those examples above some form of assessment, just like an exam, test, or quiz?</p>
<p>So why do some forms of assessment make you physically sick and other forms excite you feel good?  Because feedback is not evil, evil is.  Feedback is something necessary that we crave.  We seek it out.  We thrive on it.  And sometimes, we even enjoy it.  Any negative feelings around feedback come from evils perpetuated by a system or our own personal baggage.  More on this later.</p>
<p>How do we make all assessment useful, instructive, and enjoyable?  It has everything to do with agency and the power of questions.  And that would be an excellent topic for our next blog post.  Stay tuned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Simply put, it is the easiest way to make a quiz, send it to people, and track results.  Qzzr can be embedded anywhere and looks great on any device.</p>
<h2>Why we did this</h2>
<p>Qzzr is our answer to the combined experiences of our life and careers.  Collectively we have been public school teachers, entrepreneurs, sunday school teachers, managers of people, parents, coaches, school of rock founders, corporate trainers, keynote speakers, lifelong learners, thought leaders in online learning, designed and built learning tools for dozens of Fortune 500 companies, and creators of the world’s foremost social learning platform.  We’ve seen this problem from every angle.</p>
<p>When we started <a href="http://movementventures.com/">Movement</a>, a hatchery for great ideas, we really expected that our first product would be placed somewhere outside of the world of online learning since Josh’s last two companies have been in that space.  We started with over 70 ideas or problem spaces that we wanted to explore.  As we began validating ideas and testing markets we explored physical products, ecommerce company concepts, gas stations, and recruiting apps, but there was this one idea that kept suggesting to us that there was something left to be said and we needed to say it.  Qzzr.</p>
<h2>Why quizzes?</h2>
<p>It’s really more about feedback than quizzes specifically.  We feel like something needs to be said about feedback in the learning process and how to measure progress.  The idea of assessment has been given a bad rap by people who have the wrong idea.  It’s become punitive, not additive.  So, we’re standing up for feedback.  Feedback is a natural human desire and an inescapable part of the learning process.  The right feedback can encourage learners to dive deeper and illuminate the path for teachers and stakeholders.  And like any great teacher, we’re starting in a place everyone understands and aim to take them on the journey with us.   More on this later.</p>
<h2>Our aim</h2>
<p>We aim to show the world what learning feedback needs to look like.  Along that journey, we will provide the world’s simplest and most flexible tool for doing so.  It will always work on any device.  It will always be beautiful, wildly shareable, secure,  and dead simple to use.  It will never require special software or downloads.  There will always be a robust free version that anyone can use as well as a premium version for those who need special features.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning.  A starting place.  We invite you on this journey along with us to provide the us feedback we need to provide you the feedback you need.</p>
