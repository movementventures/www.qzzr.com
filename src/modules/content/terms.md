### Fees and Payments
You agree to pay for the Services you use on the Boombox Site in accordance the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that service.  Fees paid by you are non-refundable except as provided in these terms or when required by law.

For subscriptions, you will be billed in advance on a recurring cycle for the period you have selected (monthly or annually) at the beginning of that period.  Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each period unless you cancel automatic renewal at least 48 hours before your next renewal date.  You can cancel automatic renewal at any time.   If you do cancel automatic renewal, no refund will be provided for fees paid and your service will remain active through the end of the current billing period.

Boombox may change the fees charged for Services at any time, provided that, for subscription Services, the change will become effective only upon the next renewal date.

### Upgrades
An upgrade is when a paying customer decides to change their current plan to a more expensive paid plan.

When upgrading in the middle of a billing period, you will be given a pro-rated credit (not a refund) for the current plan which will be applied to the pro-rated charges for the upgraded plan.  At the end of the billing period, the upgraded plan will auto-renew.

### Downgrades
A downgrade is when a paying customer chooses to change their plan from a more expensive to a less expensive (but still paid) plan.  When a paying customer decides to switch from a paid plan to the free plan, that is called a cancellation.

When downgrading in the middle of a billing period, your account will receive a credit (not a refund) for the pro-rated amount for the remaining days in the billing period.  The credit will be applied toward the downgraded plan which will auto-renew at the start of the next billing period.
