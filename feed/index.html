<p>Independence Day is this weekend and—between backyard barbecues and firework shows—many individuals will be sitting back and enjoying some free time. And what do we do when we’ve got an afternoon to waste? We get on the Internet.</p>
<p>You will see all walks of life posting to your favorite social media channel during the Fourth of July weekend. Between uploading family photos and researching the perfect fried chicken recipe, everyone is bound to skim through Facebook to peek into the lives of everyone else they know.</p>
<p>Capitalize on this social media mayhem by posting the perfect, engaging US history quiz. You will need to find a balance between holiday fun and industry relevance, but if you walk that line just right, your engagement is sure to spike.<span id="more-1766"></span></p>
<p>Need some help getting started? Here is a list of conversation-starting, thought-provoking Independence Day quiz ideas that will capture your proud customers on everyone’s favorite summer weekend!</p>
<h3>1. How Much Do You Know About US History in Pop Culture?</h3>
<p>Everyone loves a bit of pop-culture trivia. Capture audiences young and old with this engaging quiz idea where everyone can participate. Where does Independence Day appear in iconic films? Which books have used Independence Day in the plot? Get families talking about their favorite cultural stars and recommending must-see movies after a few fun questions. This taxing US history quiz is bound to dominate social media with its shareable facts and goading headline.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which Star Trek character quotes the Preamble in episode 52 of the original series, “The Omega Glory?” A: Captain Kirk</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3b56e0u0EgQ" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>2. Which Founding Father Are You?</h3>
<p>This quiz headline isn’t particularly unique, but it is catchy. In fact, as I was researching this quiz idea, I found myself taking one of the many founding father quizzes out there. In case you were wondering, I’m Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a quiz doesn’t need to be one-of-a-kind, it just needs to be memorable and timely. And what is more relevant and shareable than a personality quiz that makes people feel proud to be an American?</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>One question I thought was funny from the quiz I took was:</p>
<p>Q: How tall are you?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Fairly tall</li>
<li>Fairly short</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too old to care</li>
<li>I&#8217;m too busy fighting duels to measure</li>
</ol>
<p>(Take the quiz and share your results with us in the comments!)</p>
<h3>3. Is This Tradition From the United States or Britain?</h3>
<p>Inspire the proud American in everyone on Independence Day with a quiz that highlights the differences between the United States and our motherland. You can look at how the two countries have changed, the silly laws we kept and changed over the years, the differences in holiday traditions, and any other funny facts that will interest quiz takers. Here are some examples.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: Which country participates in “worm charming” to collect bait for fishing? A: <a href="http://listverse.com/2010/04/02/10-very-strange-british-traditions/" target="_blank">Britain</a>: The competition was initiated by local man Tom Shufflebotham who on July 5, 1980, charmed 511 worms from the ground in only half an hour. The game has been held every year since as a world championship. The competition has 18 rules. Music of any kind can be used to charm worms out of the ground, but no drugs can be used. Water is considered to be a drug.</p>
<p>Q: Which country uses more pumpkins to celebrate Halloween each year? A: <a href="http://www.anglotopia.net/british-identity/lost-pond-5-major-differences-english-american-halloween-traditions/" target="_blank">The United States</a>: Illinois alone uses around 500 million a year, the UK uses about 4 million a year in total.</p>
<h3>4. How Many Americans Are Actually American?</h3>
<p>Ever wondered how American you really are? The United States has long been dubbed a melting pot for different cultures, and the actual breakdown of where today’s population originated from is interesting, and sometimes shocking. Remind quiz takers of their origins and perhaps inspire people to appreciate their culture and this great country in which we live.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: True or False? Research has found that more than 6 million Americans who self-identify as European likely carry African ancestry. A: <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/21/americans-mixed-ancestry/" target="_blank">True</a>: A study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics found this to be true, and that as many as 5 million self-described European Americans might have at least 1 percent Native American ancestry as well.</p>
<h3>5. Lies US History Taught Us: Are You Smarter Than James Loewen?</h3>
<p>Want a little controversy? This time of year, we like to pull out facts from our arsenal of American history—but how much history do we really know? The bestselling book written by James Loewen in 1995, called Lies My Teacher Told Me, outlines a number of inaccuracies in our most popular history textbooks, particularly about the settling of the United States and the idealization of national heroes. Test your followers’ US history knowledge with interesting facts and ideas inspired by Loewen. You’ll give quiz takers some food for thought and establish yourself as an edgy, knowledgeable source.</p>
<h5>Question Suggestion:</h5>
<p>Q: According to Lies My Teacher Told Me, how much more do American clothing workers make than their Malaysian counterparts? A: <a href="https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/loewen.html" target="_blank">1,500 times more</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Holidays are a great time to take advantage of the social engagement that quizzes offer. Take advantage of your potential customers’ free time and grab their attention with something funny, interesting or controversial, but always shareable.</p>
<p>Happy Independence Day!</p>
<p>Want some inspiration? Here&#8217;s a great US history quiz that has been taken over 140,000 times!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you too have been infected by the TV show Suits, you’ll recognize these all-too-common progressive symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch one episode of Suits</li>
<li>Obsess about Suits</li>
<li>Develop unsettling, yet secure man/woman-crush on Harvey Specter</li>
<li>Glance at your watch to realize it’s 4AM and you have a meeting in four hours</li>
<li>Watch one more episode</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve caught much of the show, you’ll know that Harvey is the kind of guy that says the exact right thing at the exact right time.</p>
<p>So I got to thinking, isn’t that exactly what I try to do as a content creator? <span id="more-1756"></span>And isn’t that commonality enough to create a lasting friendship that could include regular recreational activities together, like—I don’t know—driving cool cars, trying on <img class="  wp-image-1758 alignright" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NUP_143654_1381.jpg" alt="NUP_143654_1381.tif" width="369" height="208" />expensive suits, messing with Louis…</p>
<p>FOCUS, Coy! Sorry, back to my point. Harvey got where he is for a reason (and no, that’s not just because someone wrote that into a script). So I pulled the ten best Harvey Specter quotes and packaged them here for your content marketing enlightenment.</p>
<h3>The Top 10 Best Harvey Specter Quotes on Content Marketing</h3>
<h4>&#8220;I don&#8217;t pave the way for people&#8230; People pave the way for me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Success and innovation almost always go together, so move early and move fast. If you’re standing still, you’ll likely get passed over or lost in the fray. <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/23/attention-economy" target="_blank">There’s a finite amount of attention out there</a>, so only the most unique, best produced content even has a shot at being seen. Is Harvey the kind of guy that would throw together a sloppy blog post? Are you serious? I oughta slap you for even considering it.</p>
<h4>“I don’t play the odds, I play the man.”</h4>
<p>You didn’t know Harvey was into personalized marketing, did you? If there’s one thing you know about Harvey and Mike Ross, it’s that every situation and case is tirelessly researched. They don&#8217;t go into any scenario blindly (with a few disastrous exceptions), and eventually it’s a silver bullet of uncovered information that makes the difference.</p>
<p>Find out what makes your customer tick, then give them what they want—even if they themselves don’t know it yet.</p>
<h4>“That&#8217;s the difference between you and me—you wanna lose small, I wanna win big”</h4>
<p>Win big by finding out what works and then go in for the jugular. How do you do this? Research and testing, my friend.</p>
<p>Do those take time? Absolutely. Are they pleasant? Not always. But do they pay off? In spades. One example showed that testing even just the copy on a button <a href="http://copyhackers.com/2014/09/buttons-vs-headlines/" target="_blank">resulted in a 123% improvement</a> on clickthrough rate. I’d call that winning big, wouldn’t you?</p>
<h4>“It’s not bragging if it’s true.”</h4>
<p>Stop waiting for other people to talk about your successes—it may not happen. Potential customers need to know why they should give their time and money to you, and if they can’t find a reason, they’re gone. If you haven’t noticed, Harvey is not afraid to point out the fact that he’s the best, and I can’t remember one example of a client leaving to another firm (and staying there—if I’m wrong, let me know in the comments).</p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean you have to be insufferable about it, as Harvey occasionally is. While confidence and bravado are celebrated characteristics in high-powered NYC corporate law, you may not be able to get away with it in your space. Tout your strengths and showcase your wins, but do so tactfully.</p>
<p>And what’s even better than shouting your own praises? Having someone else tout them for you. A pleased-as-punch customer of ours recently wrote a guest post on the Uberflip blog, detailing the quiz they created, how they promoted it, and how it has <a href="http://hub.uberflip.com/h/i/95454123-how-one-quiz-generated-a-million-dollars" target="_blank">generated over $1.1 million in revenue</a>.</p>
<h4>&#8220;Loyalty is a two way street. If I&#8217;m asking for it from you, then you are getting it from me.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Love this one. It speaks to the symbiotic nature of companies and customers. As marketers, there is no greater goal than earning loyal customers—the kind that keep coming back time and again. However, as consumers, we value the types of businesses that listen and move to meet customer requests. It’s a complex dance in which neither party can become complacent or stationary, and every touch point is a new opportunity to strengthen or weaken that relationship.</p>
<h4>“I don’t have dreams—I have goals.”</h4>
<p>Dreams are what you spend hours thinking about, and goals are what you work tirelessly to achieve. How do you set the right kind of powerful, challenging goals? One great formula is that of <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/How-to-Set-SMART-Marketing-Goals-for-2013-TEMPLATE.aspx" target="_blank">SMART goals</a>, which says that goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Bound.</p>
<p>As an example, we set a goal in May to double the amount of <a href="http://go.qzzr.com/ebook-are-you-a-qwizard/?utm_campaign=qwizardebook&amp;utm_source=suits&amp;utm_medium=blog/" target="_blank">“Are You a Qwizard?” ebook</a> downloads, and then rolled out some new strategies to promote it. We ended up with more than a 295% increase in May, so we learned a lot about what was realistic.</p>
<h4>“I don&#8217;t get lucky. I make my own luck.&#8221;</h4>
<p>The man makes his own luck, ladies and gentlemen. Spectacular.</p>
<p>But that’s not altogether impossible. In sports, luck is thrown around a lot. “That shot was lucky” or “They got lucky” or “That was a lucky break.” Well, a lot of hard work and preparation goes into getting to the point where luck can enter into the equation.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors hadn’t done anything much more than yawn-worthy in more than 20 years. But try and tell Steph Curry that their NBA title was lucky.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="max-width: 100%;" src="//giphy.com/embed/laEnlnMj27drW" width="480" height="269" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Suits doesn’t usually do much more than allude to the hours of research and discovery that goes into their cases (if they showed it, it would be more like CSPAN, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we</span> nobody would watch it). While it’s true that you can catch a lucky break from time to time, if you’re relying on those moments to carry your marketing performance, you’re not going to last long.</p>
<h4>&#8220;The only time ‘success’ comes before ‘work’ is in the dictionary.”</h4>
<p>See above.</p>
<p>Man, Harvey can say pretty much the same thing and it still sounds so cool.</p>
<h4>“Anyone can do my job, but no one can be me.”</h4>
<p>Be irreplaceable. There are more than a million people in the US with the exact same degree, but only Harvey can be Harvey. Again, I’m aware that it’s a fictional program—but you and I both know people that have the same degree or experience that we do, but have been able to parlay that into mountainous success.</p>
<p>Look at this from a branding perspective, whether that’s from a corporate or personal standpoint. Being human is a good thing, and being yourself is even better. Brands that successfully humanize their voice enjoy more success on social media, and that translates into improved performance overall. <a href="https://moz.com/blog/4-ways-to-build-trust-and-humanize-your-brand" target="_blank">Moz has a phenomenal guide</a> to humanizing your brand.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="  wp-image-1752 alignright" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nerd-cave.jpeg" alt="nerd cave" width="304" height="230" /></p>
<p>As software engineers, our natural habitat tends to be a dimly lit nerd cave.</p>
<p>Most of us focus on the beauty of our code, the health of our servers, and fighting to keep up with the latest and greatest technologies.</p>
<p>Very rarely do we take a software engineer and put them face to face with our customers—<strong>and why not?!</strong><span id="more-1751"></span></p>
<p>It’s likely due to one of these reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s uncomfortable</li>
<li>It’s hard</li>
<li>We’re too busy</li>
</ol>
<p>It is so easy to zero in on the problems you are attempting to solve that you often forget the audience you&#8217;re attempting to solve the problem for. This needs to change.</p>
<h3>Ditch the routine</h3>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to tag along with the marketing team to the Social Media Week conference in Los Angeles. To be honest, I had some serious hesitation about subjecting myself to that level of human contact, but the experience ended up being phenomenal. Here are a few insights I took away from the experience:</p>
<h4>Marketing and Sales reps aren’t heartless, greedy monsters</h4>
<p>One of the first things that really struck me was how dedicated and amazing our marketing and sales teams are. In many organizations, sales and engineering are opposing forces, constantly struggling against one another for their own self interests. It was eye opening to see the genuine care they had for customers (existing and potential) and the desire to see them be successful on our platform. Of course sales has goals, but transactional metrics felt like secondary concerns when compared to making sure our customers were happy with the product we were providing.</p>
<h4>You can’t top facetime with customers</h4>
<p>Before the conference began, we had the opportunity to sit down with a few existing and potential customers to get feedback and brainstorm about incorporating quizzes and polls into their content strategies. These meetings were incredibly eye-opening. It was invigorating to hear success stories, as well as their challenges and struggles. In some cases, solving their pain required relatively little effort, but had it been brought back to the software engineering team, that message would likely have been lost in translation.</p>
<h4>Engineers ride in elevators, too</h4>
<p>While manning our booth, I was asked dozens of times to quickly describe what Qzzr is all about. There is something very humbling about practicing your elevator pitch. You really have to cut through the fluff and help someone understand your vision in as few words as possible. I struggled with this for a bit, and while I don&#8217;t think I ever polished my delivery as well as a standard sales team member, it did help me understand what our potential customers were most excited about.</p>
<h3>Takeaway</h3>
<p>This experience may not be for everyone, but we are adopting a rotation to allow our devs the opportunity to get out of the office for something like this. I have read posts from a variety of respectable people about getting out of the office, though I’m not sure any were directed at software engineers specifically. I can attest that it is valuable and encourage others to give it a go. <strong>Have you had any experiences with this? Share your insights in the comments below.</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>The problem arises in producing the kind of content that will resonate with an increasingly discerning public. There’s this weird phenomenon going on, where people are becoming more burned out with poorly produced “fluff” content, while searching ravenously for well-written, topical content.</p>
<p>So how do you land squarely in the latter camp—where potential customers will flock to your brand to consume, ask questions, add feedback and comments, and willingly offer up personal information in an attempt to tap into your ever-flowing nozzle of learning?</p>
<p>Recently, we had a great webinar with Skip Besthoff of InboundWriter. There was some fascinating conversation around the need for both traffic and engagement, and how to drive both.</p>
<p>We’ll embed the full video and slides at the bottom of this post, but in the meantime, here are a few tidbits of that conversation to get you pointed in the right direction:</p>
<h3>The 80/20 rule</h3>
<p>As a general rule, around 20% of your content will drive 80% of your traffic.</p>
<p>But why is this? What makes those posts so alluring? And how can you write your other posts in that vein?</p>
<p>Ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my largest source of traffic? (which specific campaign, article, etc?)</li>
<li>Which traffic converts the best?</li>
<li>Are certain types of visitors more engaged than others? Why?</li>
<li>Does engagement yield more conversions/leads?</li>
<li>What can I do to improve engagement?</li>
<li>Where should I invest resources for more traffic?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constant traffic and engagement</h3>
<p>Here’s what traffic to the average blog post will look like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.33.46-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1746" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.33.46-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-17 at 1.33.46 AM" width="1093" height="422" /></a></p>
<p>In contrast, when a post has been analytically conceived and thoughtfully written with clear engagement cues and calls to action, along with an aggressive promotion strategy, your traffic will likely begin to look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.34.07-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-17-at-1.34.07-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-17 at 1.34.07 AM" width="1048" height="416" /></a></p>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>As far as successful content marketing, quizzes are at the top of the world right now. Here are a few stats <a title="6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz (and How to Make It Viral) [Webinar]" href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/">we got from our friends at Buzzsumo</a>:</p>
<p>Quizzes have a…</p>
<ul>
<li><del></del>81% completion rate</li>
<li>2:27 average completion time</li>
<li>5% lead conversion rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s pretty extraordinary, especially since those are average numbers. Competent marketers that really take their jobs seriously may exceed those figures. Seriously.</p>
<h3>Full webinar</h3>
<p>These are just a few points we pulled from the webinar. If you’d like to watch it in its entirety, the video is below. Likewise, the slides are embedded as well.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your best content falls in the woods, does it have any value?</p>
<p>It does you little good to create the best content on Earth if no one is going to find it. So we wanted to come up with a go-to promotion strategy for marketing quizzes and other forms of interactive content. <span id="more-1709"></span></p>
<p>We’ve taught you <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to create great content</a>, <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">how to find images</a> for it, and even <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/guide-for-global-quiz-domination/" target="_blank">how to use it to take over the world</a>. So what’s the next step? Spreading the word, obviously. You’re smart, you know the basics—stick it on Facebook and Twitter, put it on your blog, send it out through your newsletter. But what about the secrets, the things that set masters apart from amateurs? Well, that’s what we’re here for. We&#8217;ve picked up a few promotion strategy tricks along the way, and would love to share them with you.</p>
<p>First, a disclaimer: depending on who your customer or market is, your promotion strategy will be different. Not everything in this post will work for everyone, so instead of offering a to-do list, we offer this list as a toolbox, letting you choose your own tools for the job at hand.</p>
<p>Now that that’s over, let us introduce you to your new go-to resources for content promotion strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1712 aligncenter" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1.png" alt="1" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Have awesome content</h3>
<p>The first step, albeit obvious, must be stated: promoting content rests on the prerequisite of having content that’s worth promoting. What makes that? Good ideas, eye-catching headlines, captivating images. You’re already salivating just thinking about it, we know. And if you’re planning on using a quiz or two, check out our tips on <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/6-steps-sweet-quiz-make-it-viral/" target="_blank">how to make it sweet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1713 aligncenter" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png" alt="2" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h3>Use who you know</h3>
<p>Take advantage of the people that already know you and like you. Not in a bad way, more in a you-liked-that-one-thing-so-let-me-show-you-something-kind-of-like-it type of way. This means any way your brand has of reaching customers, like social media, newsletters, and blogs.</p>
<p>Anywhere you have an audience that’s already shown they’re interested in what you have to say, put your content there! Since newsletter subscribers and blog viewers are fairly self-explanatory, we’ll focus mainly on how to reach your social followers. It doesn’t matter which social media platform you use most—whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, or Pinterest—something here applies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1711 aligncenter" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3.png" alt="3" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<h4>Post it!</h4>
<p>Once it goes live, make sure it goes out. On sites that allow it, use hashtags that work well in your industry; you can find them using sites like <a href="hashtagify.me" target="_blank">hashtagify.me</a> and check their effectiveness with <a href="ritetag.com" target="_blank">Rite Tag</a>. Tag the inspiration for your content or anyone you feature (we’ll talk more about this later).</p>
<h4>Post it again&#8230;and again</h4>
<p>When the internet gets over 9,000 new tweets and 2,000 new Instagram photos per second, how do you get your posts noticed? The easy solution is to post more. Here’s a few tips straight out of the Qzzr playbook:</p>
<p>Twitter: On publish, 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months<br />
Facebook: On publish, 3 days, 1 week<br />
LinkedIn: On publish, 1 week<br />
Google Plus: On publish, 1 week</p>
<p>We know what you’re thinking though: what if your followers get annoyed? Guy Kawasaki doesn&#8217;t think so—in <a title="Guy Kawasaki’s 12-Part Social Media Strategy Template" href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/guy-kawasaki-social-media-strategy-template/" target="_blank">a recent webinar </a>we did with him, <strong>he asserted that the potential for a few lost followers is well worth the risk</strong>.</p>
<p>However, facing that risk head-on may be more than you can handle. One trick is to present something different with each post, a tidbit that educates anyone who reads it, whether or not they click on your link. Never post the exact same thing twice. A few ways to introduce that variety:</p>
<p><strong>Tweet the title</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 Steps to a Sweet Quiz (and How to Make it Viral)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pose a question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Of all the forms of content out there, why should you use quizzes and how do you make a killer one?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote an author</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to make it viral: get five influencers with a retweet ratio of 2 or higher to share it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cite a statistic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know: The average quiz gets 1,900 shares and 84% of those shares are on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mention influencer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BuzzSumo’s Stephen Walsh paired up with Qzzr to talk quiz tactics, analytics, and stats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make a bold, attention-grabbing statement (that would double as a title)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t fall behind! How to join the content revolution with quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post a link</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post a photo</strong></p>
<h4>Time it right</h4>
<p>But what’s the use of posting and posting again if no one sees it? You have to post when the most people are online.</p>
<p>To schedule, use something like <a href="hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite </a>or <a href="www.tweetdeck.com" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a>. For ideas about optimal posting times, here’s what we’ve picked up in our adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>More posts/day = more engagement</li>
<li>Most blog post shares happen on Thursday</li>
<li>For the most Facebook clicks, post at 1:00pm or 3:00pm on Thursday or Friday—for the most shares, post Saturday afternoon</li>
<li>For Twitter, 5:00pm weekdays or anytime weekends is best</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pin it</h4>
<p>You’re probably thinking Pinterest, but you can pin posts in Twitter too (in Facebook, it’s called highlighting). This means anyone who looks at your profile will see these posts first.</p>
<h4>Feature your image</h4>
<p>Pinterest &amp; Instagram are image-based websites, but that doesn’t mean you should neglect photos on your other accounts. Facebook thinks posts with photos are more “important,” which makes them more likely to appear in newsfeeds, and a tweet with an image is much more noticeable than all-text.</p>
<p>We like using stock photos under the Creative Commons license (you can find photos <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank">at these websites</a>) and then editing them using <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>.</p>
<h4>Post in groups</h4>
<p>If your business is B2B or if content is directed to a very niche community, posting to groups is essential. Find Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, and Google+ communities whose members would benefit from what you’re posting. Here at Qzzr, we usually try to find two or three groups on each website that are relevant.</p>
<h4>Expand your reach</h4>
<p>Last but not least, you can always draw more eyes by paying for views, if you’re so inclined. The great thing about this is the control you have over who you’re targeting—people who are similar to your current audience, age range, demographic, etc.</p>
<h3>Find people who want to know you</h3>
<p>If you have valuable content (and of course you do), it&#8217;ll mean something to others as well. So your job is to seek out these others and let them spread your words and images to other people in the industry as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1714 aligncenter" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/promotion-post.png" alt="promotion post" width="900" height="900" /></a></p>
<h4>Bloggers &amp; influencers</h4>
<p>Find the bloggers and influencers who write about your topic and find your content valuable. But remember: someone needs a reason to read, retweet, or recommend whatever it is you send them—and sometimes, they even need a reason to open the email you send them. As Alex Turnbull, the founder of Groove, <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/1000-subscribers" target="_blank">quotes</a>, “No one cares about your content unless they care about you.”</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a catch-22: how do you make people care about your content if you don’t email them? But why would they open your emails if they don’t care about you? The secret is to start building the relationship and the conversation before you need it. Start interacting with influencers by commenting thoughtfully on their posts, retweeting their content, and then emailing them personally after they&#8217;ve seen your name and responded a few times. It’s time consuming but it’s definitely worth it.</p>
<p>You can find bloggers or influencers (people with big followings who share content similar to yours) through any of several sites. Some focus on different social platforms, and others, like BuzzSumo, are multi-purpose—you can find bloggers and Twitter influencers.</p>
<p><a href="http://BuzzSumo.com" target="_blank">BuzzSumo.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Topsy.com" target="_blank">Topsy.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Alltop.com" target="_blank">Alltop.com</a><br />
<a href="http://WeFollow.com" target="_blank">WeFollow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://Twellow.com" target="_blank">Twellow.com</a><br />
<a href="http://CircleCount.com" target="_blank">CircleCount.com</a></p>
<h4>Blogger communities</h4>
<p>Similar but sometimes more effective (results will vary), you can also submit your article to mass communities of bloggers like:</p>
<p><a href="http://triberr.com/pages/stream.php" target="_blank">Triberr</a><br />
<a href="http://www.socialbuzzclub.com/" target="_blank">Social Buzz Club</a><br />
<a href="http://bizbloggingbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Biz Blogging Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://viralcontentbuzz.com/" target="_blank">Viral Content Buzz</a><br />
<a href="http://www.justretweet.com/" target="_blank">Just Retweet</a><br />
<a href="https://izea.com/" target="_blank">Izea</a></p>
<p>Izea is a site that doesn’t really fit in this category because it functions differently. It’s a paid service where brands can find and pay social media content creators to feature their products/content. It worked well for Zenni Optical (made them <a title="The Anatomy of the Million Dollar Quiz [Webinar]" href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/million-dollar-quiz-revenue/" target="_blank">over $1 million!</a>).</p>
<h4>Link roundups</h4>
<p>Link roundups are another way to get your content out there. Many bloggers send out daily or weekly newsletters with a list of their favorite articles or links around the web. For example, <a href="https://mattermark.com/category/mattermark-daily/">Mattermark</a> and <a href="http://foundcy.com/">Foundcy</a> do this with startup-related content. Google something like “link roundup” or “weekly link roundup” along with a category name, and email the organizer.</p>
<h4>Forums and submissions</h4>
<p>Submit post to relevant chains. Find a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">reddit</a> that’s similar to what you do. Or, if you&#8217;re in a very popular or large industry like startups or tech, you can submit to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a> for tech or <a href="http://inbound.org/">Inbound.org</a> and <a href="https://growthhackers.com/">Growth Hackers</a> for marketing. Forums are also a good niche place to send your content to—just find ones that apply to you and are made up of audiences that would find value in what you post. And just like with bloggers and influencers, it&#8217;s best to have a good standing within the group before you start posting.</p>
<h3>Put yourself out there</h3>
<p>Curation and aggregation get confused a lot. The easiest way to distinguish the two? Aggregation is usually automatic or, at least, not filtered based on any standard of quality, just amassed by keywords. Curated content is manually selected by someone and usually republished by that person with fresh insights, a new headline, or personal commentary. In other words, aggregation is collecting, while curation is choosing what&#8217;s in that collection. Both are great for submitting to to expose a wider audience to what you&#8217;re writing or making.</p>
<h4>Content curation platforms</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of popular content curation platforms across the web. (We debated keeping <a href="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis/confirm">Digg</a> on the list, but it seems to have passed its hey-day. No harm in submitting there anyways though, right?)</p>
<p><a href="stumbleupon.com" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a><br />
<a href="http://www.scoop.it/" target="_blank">Scoop.it</a><br />
<a href="http://paper.li/" target="_blank">Paper.li</a><br />
<a href="https://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a></p>
<p>The website that we&#8217;re most familiar with on the list is StumbleUpon, so we&#8217;ll stick with giving you advice on that one. First, you submit the page by logging into your StumbleUpon account. Stumblers love things like videos, tutorials, infographics, images, and lists. Interactive is even better—quizzes, anyone? If you&#8217;re serious about getting &#8220;stumbles,&#8221; add a StumbleUpon badge to your page to increase organic traffic, and share StumbleUpon&#8217;s custom URL on your social media. Lastly, you can track analytics—the views and likes on your submitted piece—by clicking on the &#8220;Your Likes&#8221; portion of your profile.</p>
<h4>Content aggregators</h4>
<p>Here are a few aggregators that cover different topics. Same as the curation platforms, most of them require you to create an account before submitting content.</p>
<p><a href="alltop.com" target="_blank">AllTop.com</a><br />
<a href="affposts.com" target="_blank">AffPosts.com</a><br />
<a href="affbuzz.com" target="_blank">AffBuzz.com</a><br />
<a href="affdaily.com" target="_blank">AffDaily.com</a></p>
<h3>Get discovered</h3>
<p>Content discovery/syndication networks are the ones that “suggest” more content from you whenever you’re on a publisher site like CNN, Time Magazine, or National Geographic. The most well-known content discovery networks are <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/">Outbrain</a> and <a href="http://taboola.com/">Taboola</a>—both of them offer analytics, allow geographical targeting, and strive to drive organic traffic.</p>
<p>The choice of what to use is yours, but here are a few general tips:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Make your page easy to share. The whole point of having your content &#8220;discovered&#8221; is the organic traffic that comes with it—along with the organic shares. Are your share buttons always visible and accessible to the user?</li>
<li>Try to get more out of every person who visits your site. Ask for, at best, an email (maybe in exchange for premium content like an ebook) or, at worst, a Facebook like or Twitter follow.</li>
<li>Build your retargeting audience. Use Google Analytics to build an audience based on the landing page for your Outbrain or Taboola campaign. This way, anyone who&#8217;s visited your site as a result of content discovery will see your ads as they continue to search the web, keeping you in their mind for the extent of their web-surfing duration.</li>
<li>Test-launch your content. You can use discovery networks to test different headlines against each other, like a soft launch or A/B testing. If you do this before a print run or making something premium content, it can save you a lot of time and money.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Reuse what you have</h4>
<p>Why do more work than you have to? Republish &amp; repurpose your old content that works. Make an infographic, podcast, slideshare, or—even better—a quiz! Here’s a full list of things you can turn one high-performing post into:</p>
<p>Infographic<br />
Slideshare presentation<br />
<a href="https://www.qzzr.com/" target="_blank">Quiz</a><br />
<a href="https://www.pollcaster.com/" target="_blank">Poll</a><br />
Guest post<br />
Webinar<br />
Ebook<br />
PDF<br />
Podcast<br />
Video<br />
Email course<br />
List</p>
<p>You can also straight republish your content on sites like Quora, LinkedIn, and Medium. Just remember to link back to your original content and make allowances to how it will affect analytics.</p>
<p>Well, that’s that! Let us know your successes or failures with any of these platforms in the comments—or if we&#8217;ve left anything major out of our content promotion strategy guide, let us know. And if you want to hear about a quiz-specific success story, learn how <a href="http://www.internetmarketinginc.com/blog/case-study-million-dollar-quiz/" target="_blank">IMI made a quiz for Zenni Optical that generated a million dollars</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all seen them on our social feeds (and if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves, we&#8217;ve taken many of them).</p>
<p>In fact, quizzes have long been the most shared form of content on the web. In January, quizzes made up nine of the top ten most shared stories on Facebook—that&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p>But how do you tap into that power and create the type of quiz social natives flock to?</p>
<p>We met up with NUVI today to take on this challenge. You see, there&#8217;s something about quizzes that get people talking. They can&#8217;t keep from taking to Facebook and Twitter to display their scores and throw down a challenge to their friends and followers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Think you have what it takes to be an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenStack?src=hash">#OpenStack</a> Master? Take the OpenStack Challenge quiz to find out! <a href="http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2">http://t.co/mtEbeW38c2</a></p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>See? I thought <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> was an amateur Jenga tournament, and even I want to take that quiz just to prove I&#8217;m a Master (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read" target="_blank">tl;dr</a>: I&#8217;m not a Master). Even if they&#8217;re not gloating or challenging, they&#8217;re chipping in on the conversation with opinions and tidbits. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForPaul?src=hash">#ForPaul</a> MT <a href="https://twitter.com/RomanciaSays">@RomanciaSays</a>: I think I got Paul&#8217;s car. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fast7?src=hash">#Fast7</a> <a href="https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC">https://t.co/Nh6nfpgUNC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/quizzes?src=hash">#quizzes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CarListerCo">@CarListerCo</a> <a href="http://t.co/kpcRPFlhJK">pic.twitter.com/kpcRPFlhJK</a> — TV After Dark (@TVAfterDark) <a href="https://twitter.com/TVAfterDark/status/600757086239072260">May 19, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you create and promote the right quiz, social media will erupt in conversation.<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2>Check it out</h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>As you may have noticed while we were presenting, we had some technical difficulties due to a drop in internet connection. This caused some problems with the original recording. But since we wanted to make sure you got the full account, we pulled from another webinar with nearly identical content, and spliced it with the awesome insights we got from Bill and the guys at NUVI. The NUVI art starts at the 37:24 mark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media quizzes are a great way to engage with your audience in a personal and direct way, but not all quizzes are created equal. Just as any content can be created impeccably, there are a few common mistakes many quiz creators make that ruin their engagement results.</p>
<p>The secrets to reaching social media quiz sharing success are not difficult, but are often overlooked, causing numerous brands to miss out on growing their audience to new, wanting members.</p>
<h2>Don’t trip into these social media quiz pitfalls!</h2>
<h4>1. You don’t make your results shareable</h4>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to really educate your audience about your product, a quiz may not be the most in-depth solution. Quizzes are not the best format for informational posts—at least in this medium. Instead, use a social media quiz to educate users about your brand in a short, fun and conversational way.</p>
<p>Quizzes are great for brand awareness. For them to be effective, they should be easy to share. When the quiz taker gets their results, they need an immediate way to post to Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. The general consensus is that the format should show the results first and then the title of the quiz second. For example: “You’re Princess Jasmine! – Which Disney Princess Are You? Take the quiz here to find out!”</p>
<h4>2. Your quiz is too long</h4>
<p>With the average attention span at an alltime low, you have just a few short seconds to engage your audience with useful, entertaining content before they move on to the next shiny thing.</p>
<p>The most successful quizzes average between seven and ten questions. Keep your questions succinct and to the point; big blocks of text are sure to yield fewer results than pithy inquiries. And keep your results short as well. It is a delicate balance, however. You definitely want people taking social media quizzes to feel like they’re receiving quality feedback at the end of the quiz, so dip much less than seven and your credibility will suffer. But, as a general rule, wordy explanations that take longer to read result in fewer shares.</p>
<h4>3. You don’t use enough (good) images</h4>
<p>Make up for less text by using quality images. The old saying, “a picture is worth a thousand words,” holds true in quizzes as much as anything else.</p>
<div class="mv-widget" data-widget="poll" data-id="UuUdehUt7qnKXxzDpLIKwH7ymH2" data-width="100%" data-height="auto"></div>
<p><script src="//d6launbk5pe1s.cloudfront.net/widget.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>If you’re going to spend a lot of time on any aspect of the quiz you’re creating, spend it on the most focal image. The main image seen is what draws users to your quiz in the first place.</p>
<p>Images historically receive more shares on social media than text, and a quiz post is made up of 80% image. Ultimately, the photo replaces the “lede sentence” that hooks the audience in a typical text post.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/top-10-best-websites-copyright-free-images/" target="_blank"><img class="  wp-image-1700 alignright" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Images-CTA.png" alt="Images CTA" width="305" height="159" /></a>Not just any cool image will do here. Your lede photo should be relevant to your content, as well as high quality. A low resolution, pixelated image will be scrolled over by most viewers. Studies also show that <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/01/brain-face-recognition/" target="_blank">images with faces tend to do better than photos without</a>. The human brain is programed to look for other humans. These images are familiar and relatable, which makes them more clickable and shareable.</p>
<p>Images don’t just apply to the introduction to your quiz, either. High quality photos should be sprinkled throughout. Use images as questions or answers in your quiz, and especially to demonstrate the results.</p>
<h4>4. Your title sucks</h4>
<p>A close second to finding a great lede image is creating a catchy title. Think of it as the image drawing their attention, but the title giving the audience a reason to click. In fact, research shows that <a href="https://moz.com/blog/are-your-titles-irresistibly-click-worthy-viral" target="_blank">80% of post clicks</a> are motivated by a headline alone.</p>
<p>Your title should stick out in the massive content mill of social media, so here are a few tried and true tricks to make your social media quiz stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favorite the Famous</strong> &#8211; Studies show that people are more likely to click on a title with a celebrity’s name in it than one without. Why? We like to see ourselves as celebrities and we relate to famous things. Who wouldn’t want to be like Beyonce or doesn’t see a bit of their own friend group in the “Friends” cast?</li>
<li><strong>Rate Users</strong> &#8211; These headings are best used for personality quizzes. Titles like, “Which Television Anti-hero Are You?” give you a creative way to rate and analyze people, which users then want to share with their friends.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of “Actually”</strong> &#8211; You can easily turn a boring title into something provocative by throwing in the word “actually.” Instead of asking, “What’s Your Sense of Humor?” entice users by saying, “Do You Actually Have a Sense of Humor?”</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Your quiz is depressing</h4>
<p>Users don’t take a social media quiz to feel badly about themselves. <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/make-quiz-like-buzzfeed/" target="_blank">Boost your quiz shareability with positive results</a> that make people excited to brag about it on social media.</p>
<p>It might seem like a controversial result technique will be provocative enough to get shares, but the research shows otherwise.</p>
<p>Don’t bum users out with negative feedback, but don’t lie either. Results that are too broad or overly positive feel like they’re pandering, and people are less likely to share those with friends. Instead, focus your questions and results around uplifting verbiage and honest answers.</p>
<h4>6. Your quiz is a trap</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trap.png"><img class="  alignright wp-image-1702" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trap.png" alt="social media quiz trap" width="332" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>And not in a good way.</p>
<p>This goes back to the purpose of using quizzes in your marketing strategy. The goal of quizzes isn’t always to get leads, but also to create educational and entertaining ways to spread brand awareness. You don’t necessarily need to use quizzes to create an email newsletter mailing list, but instead could use them as a fun format designed for shareability about your brand. Pair the message with the intended result, and compare that to where the audience is in respect to your funnel.</p>
<p>You can generate leads from a social media quiz, but this is done through providing personalized recommendations, not blackmailing quiz users into giving you their information. If your quiz can help users determine the type of product you offer that most suits their needs, they may be motivated to subscribe to your newsletters or purchase a product. But that decision should be the user’s initiative, not yours.</p>
<p>Trapping people into giving you personal information before showing results will lead most users to opt-out of your quiz all together, which means you don’t get to show them more information about your brand, lift their spirits, or get social media shares that drive more traffic. When people feel like they’re given something that was tailored for them, they’re much more likely to opt-in, as opposed to just being blindly marketed at.</p>
<h4>7. Your quiz is boring</h4>
<p>Buzzfeed, one of the most successful websites using quiz-based traffic generation, keeps their audience clicking with engaging content, both visually and integrally. Big, colorful fonts and lots of images keep the user entertained aesthetically while the conversational, witty content engages their mind.</p>
<p>Avoid using quizzes as methods for hardcore learning, and instead don’t be afraid to be funny, and even snarky in your quiz content. Studies show that using personal pronouns, like “I,” “we” and “you,” create a more conversational, personalized tone that prompts readers to view and share your quiz.</p>
<p>This especially applies to the results of your quiz. <a title="Why People Share Awesome Content" href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/people-share/" target="_blank">Users want to feel like their results are unique and specially tailored just for them</a>, so write your results as if you’re writing to a single person, not a large audience. Try picturing a friend that matches the answers you’re writing and create content directly to them. It will come out more casual and connected than writing to an imaginary audience, which can seem formulaic.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Become a quiz-creating guru by inserting these simple steps into your everyday process. Orchestrating outstanding quizzes that engage your audience and build your brand is an attainable skill if you avoid these common quiz mistakes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lovethatshot.co.uk/icon-prom-from-love-that-shot-photography/"><img class="  alignright wp-image-1668" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/prom-couple.jpg" alt="prom-couple" width="360" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>A 5% lead conversion rate is a lot like asking your cousin to prom. Sure—it&#8217;s better than nothing, but you and I both know it could be a whole lot better.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s webinar, we sat down with Sushant Sharma of <a href="https://vwo.com/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a> to discuss how quizzes are driving killer conversion rates. To say it was a helpful conversation would be grossly inadequate. Read on to get a few insights into the process behind 20-30% conversion rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/marketing-quiz" target="_blank">As I recently discussed on the Wordstream blog</a>, we recently discovered that Qzzr quizzes ending with lead capture forms were successful at acquiring a lead 10% of the time. Yeah, that&#8217;s the average! It only took basic marketing prowess to get above average conversion rates.</p>
<p>What would you do if your conversion rates were that high?</p>
<p>Owen and Sushant shared countless quiz tips (and you really should watch the webinar below to get all of them), but we&#8217;ll highlight just three that will get you started:</p>
<h4>Know your audience</h4>
<p>Quizzes and polls are examples of interactive content, but without knowing who you&#8217;re designing the quiz for, there&#8217;s not going to be much interaction. Here&#8217;s a quick diagram that illustrates precisely the mindset you should be in when designing your quiz.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1669" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-29-at-12.03.14-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-29 at 12.03.14 AM" width="1074" height="603" /></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t do you a bit of good to create a quiz that only you would want to take. This seems obvious, but it&#8217;s remarkably common. Learn as much as you can about your target personas.</p>
<p>What challenges do they face? What entertains them? What do they want to learn more about? Maybe draw inspiration from the news or pop culture, depending on your audience. Find that happy middle where interaction flows naturally. Turn that prom date from awkward cousin conversation into riveting, engaging dialogue. That&#8217;s what spurs an above average conversion rate.</p>
<h4>Show me something cool</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png"><img class="  wp-image-1671 alignright" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogbounty.png" alt="dogbounty" width="378" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Quizzes are by nature much more social than other forms of content. They&#8217;re personal. So ditch the office-speak and loosen the tie and have a little fun with it.</p>
<p>Remember this quiz from the webinar? Again, pardon the crass title, but it&#8217;s not what you think. This is from the College Humor quiz <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6971979/quiz-whose-boobs-are-these">&#8220;Whose cleavage is this?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t recognize him, this is Dog the Bounty Hunter. While I&#8217;m not sure if I would classify his cleavage as &#8220;cool,&#8221; you get the point. This quiz is engaging because it&#8217;s out of the ordinary and combats the overarching assumption.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another one, since we&#8217;re on the bounty hunter theme (no, I&#8217;m not going to make any references to the <del>hit</del> <a href="https://youtu.be/e4N220XLowE" target="_blank">90s bounty hunter-themed TV show Renegade</a>). When Sideshow Collectibles made this quiz: <a href="https://www.sideshowtoy.com/blog/quiz-which-star-wars-bounty-hunter-are-you" target="_blank">&#8220;Which Star Wars bounty hunter are you?&#8221;</a>, they could&#8217;ve asked simple, straightforward questions. But they saw the magic of a quiz, and created questions like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png"><img class="  wp-image-1672 alignleft" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scum.png" alt="scum" width="459" height="275" /></a></p>
<p>A quiz is not a real assessment. You aren&#8217;t confined by the bounds of scientific thought and limits, so again—have some fun with it.</p>
<h4>Help me feel sufficiently assessed</h4>
<p>I know I just said quizzes aren&#8217;t real assessments, but I wasn&#8217;t completely serious. They need to retain some degree of legitimacy for people to invest in the result. If your quiz is three questions long, but then you try and offer me insights about who I am, it&#8217;s not going to seem legitimate to me and I&#8217;ll be significantly less likely to share my results.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1673" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/how-many-questions.png" alt="how many questions" width="1024" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>The quiz on the left isn&#8217;t likely to make me feel confident in the result I get. &#8220;Oh, I should buy a Lexus? You asked me three questions, I don&#8217;t think you know me well enough to make that kind of call.&#8221; However, in the quiz on the right, there are 10 questions to ascertain my personality, preferences, and character. So the fact that I get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_302_Mustang" target="_blank">Boss 302</a> makes me want to brag about it to my friends.</p>

<p>One of the three most important tricks to making a quiz is great imagery (<a href="https://www.qzzr.com/blog/3-tips-will-help-make-engaging-quizzes/" target="_blank">the other two being an engaging topic and eye-catching title</a>). Easy enough, right? If only that were true—landing the right pictures can be a real chore. Unfortunately, it isn’t really feasible to have an on-staff photographer for all your quizzes (as nice as that would be), but looking for images on the web means worrying about licenses and usage rights. Well let us take care of that for you! <strong>We put together an easy resource to help you easily find the best copyright-free images on the web.</strong></p>
<h4>Want a personalized recommendation? Scroll to the bottom to take our quiz!</h4>
<p>We all know about Google Images filter by usage rights, Flickr, and Getty Images. But our favorite websites are the ones with fantastic photographers, pages and pages of photos, and—of course—easy-to-use search (because no one wants to scroll past pages of landscape when what you really need is a picture of a car). There are so many great new sites with an emphasis on completely free, breathtaking photos that we just had to share them with you. <strong>(Note: Not all images are copyright-free. Some of them may require attribution, so be sure to check out the license for each site you use.)</strong></p>
<p>Have a favorite that’s not on our list? Link it in the comments and share the love.</p>
<h2>The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images</h2>
<h3>10. <a href="http://www.imcreator.com/free" target="_blank">IM Free</a></h3>
<p>Made by IMCreator, IM Free has a well-categorized inventory of thousands of stock photos. It’s loaded in the Cityscape, People, and Nature categories, but falls a little short if you need pictures for something about tech or business. Just remember that any image off this site needs attribution to the creator.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1610 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>(Photos by Jonathan Kos-Read, Instant Vantage, and 55Laney69)</p>
<h3>9. <a href="http://negativespace.co/" target="_blank">Negative Space</a></h3>
<p>The selection is limited, but the best part of Negative Space is that you can sort by color or even copy space position (for your non-quiz stock photo needs). And if you want to try your hand at design or editing, you can download the raw file too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1611 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>8. <a href="http://magdeleine.co/browse/" target="_blank">Magdeleine</a></h3>
<p>A small collection (couple hundred) of photos to be used more for inspiration than anything. What’s special about this site is the ability to filter by dominant color.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1612 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>7. <a href="https://stocksnap.io/" target="_blank">StockSnap</a></h3>
<p>The selection on StockSnap might be a bit limited, but that’s because the two-person team curates and hand-selects each photo for a “bad ass repository of beautiful stock photography.” The layout isn’t bad either, showing you the number of views and downloads for each photo and also letting you see what’s trending on the site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1613 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>6. <a href="http://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a></h3>
<p>Pexels has over 2000 photos chosen from other stock photo sites across the internet. It’s an easy-on-the eyes site with a great selection. One downside is there’s no categorization, so trying to browse photos may get a little messy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1614 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://stockphotos.io/" target="_blank">StockPhotos.io</a></h3>
<p>If you’re a Pinterest lover, you’re in luck: StockPhoto.io’s website is almost the same. StockPhotos.io has 30,000+ photos (all searchable!), well tagged and well categorized. There’s also an illustrations board, if that’s more up your alley.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1615 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>4. <a href="http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/stock-up" target="_blank">Stock Up</a></h3>
<p>This one might be cheating a little: Stock Up consolidates 21 different copyright-free image sites, including great sites like Life of Pix and New Old Stock Photos, into one. Clean layout and easy search are a plus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1616 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>3. <a href="http://picjumbo.com/" target="_blank">PicJumbo</a></h3>
<p>It may not be the prettiest site you’ve ever seen (and definitely not the most ad-free), but the categories and tags—not to mention the sheer volume of photos—definitely make PicJumbo worth it. Also a bonus is the fact that you can see other tags on photos you’re looking at. If you’re so inclined, going premium means you can download bundles of photos.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1617 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>2. <a href="http://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a></h3>
<p>Not only does Pixabay have 380,000+ photos, it also has vectors and drawings. The categorization and search is impeccable—and you can see a photographer’s entire collection. The size selection at download is pretty nifty too. Oh, and did we mention each photo’s hand-picked for quality?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/9.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1618 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/9.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h3>1. <a href="http://finda.photo/" target="_blank">FindA.Photo</a></h3>
<p>Like Stock Up, FindA.Photo is also a collection site &#8211; it takes its thousands of photos from Unsplash, MMT, and Picography among others—but with a kick: browsing by HTML color code. Just type “&#8211;color #000000” (replace #000000 with the HTML code of the color you’re looking for) into the search bar. You can also <a href="http://finda.photo/search/tips#tags">search with width or height</a>, aspect ratio, or the average saturation of the image (great for finding black-and-whites.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1619 size-full" src="https://www.qzzr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10.png" alt="The Top 10 Best Websites to Find Copyright-Free Images" width="600" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>There you go—ten of the best copyright-free image websites on the web! But maybe ten&#8217;s too many and you can&#8217;t narrow it down. Don&#8217;t worry, Qzzr&#8217;s got you covered. Take our quiz and we&#8217;ll <em>tell</em> you which website is best for you.</p>
<div class="quizz-container" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-quiz="65564"></div>
<p><script src="//dcc4iyjchzom0.cloudfront.net/widget/loader.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>Can’t get enough copyright-free images? Here are some sites we’ve found that’ll send you a few new ones by newsletter every week or so.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://unsplash.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=655606e77350bfa30e1ab5457&amp;id=9493051dec" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>: 10 absolutely stunning, minimalistic pictures every 10 days. Also has <a href="https://unsplash.com/">a great site</a> (albeit a somewhat limited search functionality) that FindA.Photo and others pull from.</li>
<li><a href="http://littlevisuals.co/" target="_blank">Little Visuals</a>: 7 photos every week.</li>
<li><a href="http://join.deathtothestockphoto.com/" target="_blank">Death to the Stock Photo</a>: This “coffee for the modern creative” sends photos every month.</li>

<li><a href="http://newsletter.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a>: We mentioned Pexels above in #6, but we wanted to add their monthly newsletter to the mix too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want to pay for your stock photos, there’s a market for that too. Some of our favorites:</p>
